Then compare the first number with the second number - compare 3 with 8 - and if the first number is larger, swap the numbers. In this case, 8 is larger than 3, so no swapping is needed. Then, compare 8 with the third number - 5. In this case, 5 is smaller than 8, so 8 and 5 will be swapped and the first three numbers in the list will now be sorted. Repeat this process with the rest of the numbers, resulting in the sorted list: 1, 3, 5, 8, 9."}, {"instruction": "How does data deduplication work?", "input": "", "output": "Data deduplication is a process wherein duplicate files are identified and eliminated, resulting in fewer copies of the same file stored. In this process, the original file is compressed first so that the most space can be saved. The compression algorithm applied to the data blocks compares the contents of each file to detect duplication. If two or more copies of the same file are found, only one copy is kept and the rest are discarded. This reduces the overall space required to store the files, while maintaining the original file integrity."}]
