Both algorithms guarantee to find the optimal path from the source node to the goal node. \n\nThe main difference between these algorithms is that the Dijkstra's algorithm uses a Breadth-first search approach, while the A* algorithm adopts a Heuristic-based search approach. Dijkstra's algorithm is a simple and straightforward pathfinding algorithm, while the A* algorithm is more complex and efficient and uses the heuristic function to determine the most efficient path. Additionally, Dijkstra’s algorithm is not informed and uses uniform-cost search while A* is informed and uses the heuristic cost."}, {"instruction": "Classify this object as plant, animal, or mineral.", "input": "Honey bee", "output": "Animal"}, {"instruction": "Create a timeline of events that led to the Civil Rights Movement in the United States.", "input": "", "output": "1896: The Supreme Court issued its infamous Plessy v Ferguson decision, which declared constitutional the “separate but equal” doctrine applied to racial segregation.\n\n1954: The Supreme Court issued its landmark Brown v.
