At the boiling point, the vapor pressure of the liquid is equal to the atmospheric pressure. Generally, the boiling point of a liquid is higher than its melting point, as it takes a greater amount of energy to convert a liquid into a gas than it does to turn a solid into a liquid. The boiling point can vary with different conditions, such as atmospheric pressure and temperature, in addition to the type of liquid and its composition."}]
