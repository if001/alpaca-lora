SEO requires time, patience and knowledge to ensure the best possible results. \n\nMeanwhile, SEM is a type of online marketing that utilizes paid advertising to reach out and promote products, services or content. These campaigns may be targeted at organic and paid search results as well as social media and other websites. SEM is much more immediate than SEO, with results often taking days, rather than months or years. SEM is a powerful tool for increasing a website’s visibility and boosting its traffic."}]
