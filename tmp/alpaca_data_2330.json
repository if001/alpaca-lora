Additionally, hybrid cloud systems give organizations the ability to harness cost efficiencies by distributing compute resources across multiple providers. \n\nDisadvantages of using a hybrid cloud system include the potential for increased complexity, higher costs than private or public cloud solutions, and security and privacy concerns. Hybrid cloud systems need a consistent set of policies and procedures to ensure functionality and performance across all cloud systems.
