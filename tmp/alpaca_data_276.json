He kept a close eye on his crops and was always ready to jump into action should any pests or weather disrupt his harvest. All the villagers knew him as a hard worker and reliable provider, and would often come to him for advice if the need arose.\n\nTom was happiest when he was surrounded by nature. He'd take his dog for a walk in the nearby woods, or watch the sun rise with a cup of coffee in his hand. Life in the village was peaceful and uncomplicated, and it suited him just fine. On a clear night he'd gaze at the stars, feel the stillness of his surroundings, and be reminded how lucky he was.\n\nTom was content with his simple life, and he didn't need much else to feel whole. When storms and difficulties came his way, he faced them head on with resilience and courage. As long as he had his farm and nature, he was a happy man."}, {"instruction": "Turn this statement into an open-ended question.", "input": "Animals are affected by climate change.", "output": "How are animals affected by climate change?"}, {"instruction": "Find the shortest path from point A to point B using a GPS trajectory.", "input": "Point A = (41.65407° N, 91.53147° W)\nPoint B = (41.65104° N, 91.52863° W)", "output": "41.65407°N, 91.53147°W, 41.653475°N, 91.53124°W, 41.65219°N, 91.53063°W, 41.65104°N, 91.52863°W"}, {"instruction": "Given a logical statement, output the negation of the statement in propositional logic.", "input": "P implies Q", "output": "¬P or ¬Q"}, {"instruction": "Given a set of instructions, output the instructions in order of priority, from the highest priority to the lowest priority.", "input": "Answer phone, book flight, write report", "output": "Answer phone, book flight, write report"}, {"instruction": "Extract all the nouns from the sentence and output them in a list.", "input": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", "output": "['fox', 'dog']"}, {"instruction": "Given two strings, find out if the second string is a substring of the first string.
