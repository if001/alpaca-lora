The layer-by-layer approach requires users to understand the basic moves of the cube. In the beginner's method, the user must first solve two layers at a time before moving to the third. Fridrich's rotational method is a bit more involved and requires an understanding of cube notation and algorithms. Finally, the Corners First method requires some prior knowledge of cubes although it can be learned on the go."}, {"instruction": "Add a feature in the given code so that it can accept wildcards and special characters.", "input": "# Python 3 program to validate \n# IPv4 address \n\n# Function to validate a given IPv4 address. \ndef validate_IPv4(s): \n    l = s.split(\".\") \n    if len(l) != 4: \n        return False\n    for x in l: \n        if not x.isdigit() or int(x)>255: \n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Driver Code \ns = \"192.168.1.2\"\nif validate_IPv4(s): \n    print(\"valid\") \nelse: \n    print(\"Invalid\")", "output": "# Python 3 program to validate \n# IPv4 address \n\n# Function to validate a given IPv4 address. \ndef validate_IPv4(s): \n    l = s.split(\".\") \n    if len(l) != 4: \n        return False\n    for x in l: \n        if x != '*' and x != '#' and (not x.isdigit() or int(x)>255): \n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Driver Code \ns = \"192.168.1.*\"\nif validate_IPv4(s): \n    print(\"valid\") \nelse: \n    print(\"Invalid\")"}, {"instruction": "Edit the sentence as follows - keep the same meaning but make the sentence shorter.", "input": "The athlete finished the race but was nonetheless discouraged by the result.", "output": "The athlete finished the race, but was disappointed."}, {"instruction": "given a sentence, generate a similar sentence that has a different perspective.", "input": "He was too afraid to cross the river.", "output": "She was bold enough to cross the river."}, {"instruction": "Write a description that conveys the given information about a creature.", "input": "Name: Basilisk\nSize: 6 feet tall\nLifespan: 200 years", "output": "The legendary Basilisk is a mythical creature resembling a giant serpent, standing 6 feet in height.
