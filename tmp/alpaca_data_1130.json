The book is a narrative of the adventures of Lady Susan Vernon, a rose-colored, middle-aged woman. It is full of intrigue, deception, and sly humor that Jane Austen fans are sure to appreciate. The author, Whit Stillman, puts his take on the classic tale with his wit and clever dialogue. I particularly enjoyed the underlying themes of art, music and literature, and the battle between love and friendship. I recommend this book highly to any reader who enjoys a romping tale and clever writing."}]
