The novel tells the story of a group of animals living on a farm run by humans, who are eventually overthrown by the animals. The book follows the animals as they attempt to construct a society run by animals, and follows the rise and fall of their new leadership.

Then, divide both sides of the equation by 7, giving us x^2 + 2/7x = -1. Finally, completing the square on the left hand side by adding 1/7 and taking the square root yields (x+1/7)^2 = 6/7.

Elements in the same group, or column, of the periodic table have the same number of protons and electrons, giving them the same elemental properties. For example, all alkali metals (group 1A) have a single valence electron, giving them similar properties such as low densities and high reactivity. This is because all of their atoms have the same number of protons, electrons, and neutrons."}, {"instruction": "Answer the following question: How can renewable energy be used to combat climate change?", "input": "", "output": "Renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydropower can significantly reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and help to mitigate climate change.

The most common type of virus is the Trojan Horse virus, which masquerades as a legitimate program and once installed, causes damage by deleting files and corrupting data. Computer viruses can be transmitted via email attachments, external storage devices, and malicious websites. When a virus is activated, it is capable of replicating itself and may spread via peer-to-peer connections and other networks, making it difficult to stop the infection before it causes serious damage."}]
