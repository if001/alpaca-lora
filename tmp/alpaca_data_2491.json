It lies between 50 and 80 km in altitude and is characterized by the coldest temperatures in Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nThe thermosphere is the fourth layer of Earth’s atmosphere and is the highest layer of the atmosphere, extending from 80 km to 660 km in altitude. It’s characterized by very high temperatures, which increase with altitude.\n\nThe exosphere is the fifth layer of Earth’s atmosphere, and extends from 660 km to 10,000 km in altitude. It is the layer where most of the atoms and molecules in the atmosphere escape into space.\n\nThe troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth’s atmosphere, extending from sea level to 10 km in altitude. It’s characterized by the presence of clouds and weather, as it is the layer where the weather in Earth’s atmosphere takes place.\n\nThe tropopause is the dividing line between the troposphere and the stratosphere, and is typically found at a height of 10 km to 16 km in altitude. It is marked by a sudden decrease in temperature, as the air temperature in the troposphere decreases with height, and the air temperature in the stratosphere increases with height."}]
