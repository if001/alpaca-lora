[{"instruction": "Explain a quantum force.", "input": "", "output": "A quantum force is a force that acts on subatomic particles at the quantum level. These forces allow particles to interact and form complex structures like atoms and molecules, and include strong and weak nuclear forces, the electromagnetic force, and gravity. The strong nuclear force is responsible for holding the nucleus of an atom together, while the weak nuclear force is responsible for certain kinds of radioactive decay. The electromagnetic force binds the electrons in an atom to the nucleus, and is also responsible for attraction and repulsion between objects with electric charge. Finally, gravity is the force that binds together galaxies and governs the motion of planetary bodies."}, {"instruction": "Answer this question: \nWhat are the top five countries in the world in terms of population?", "input": "", "output": "The top five countries in the world in terms of population are China, India, the United States, Indonesia and Brazil.
