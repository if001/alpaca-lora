The castle was majestic and foreboding, with its large stone walls and thick metal gates. He had heard tales of what was inside, tales of a mysterious figure that dwelled within its depths. But despite the warnings, he was determined to find out what secrets the castle held. \n\nAs he reached the gate, he was filled with anticipation. He took a deep breath and opened the gate. Once inside, he saw a long cobblestone path lined with trees and statues. He followed the path, his steps echoing with each step he took. Slowly he made his way to the castle, only to be stopped by something unexpected. There, at the door of the grand castle, was a small child. \n\nThe child looked up at him and smiled. He couldn't believe his eyes but he was determined to find out more. He crouched down and asked the child what he was doing here by himself. The child replied that he was looking for someone special and he thought he'd found him. At those words, the man couldn't help but grin. He would now venture even further into the castle, sure that whatever secrets it held would be revealed soon."}, {"instruction": "Generate five questions about the following article with one sentence answer each.", "input": "Apple Inc. recently released its new iPhone 12 that supports 5G technology.", "output": "1.

This can be done by using a series of algorithms, involving “triple flips”, “uneven swap” and “loopen”. \n\nThe Layer-By-Layer algorithm involves solving each layer of the cube independently. This algorithm utilizes the idea of creating a “cross” on the top layer, and then solving each corner and edge of the cube one-by-one. \n\nThese techniques can be combined to form an algorithm to solve a Rubik’s cube."}, {"instruction": "What invention from the 1950s still has an impact today?", "input": "", "output": "The invention of the transistor in 1947 had a massive impact on modern society.
