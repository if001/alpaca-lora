She stepped out of the darkness and walked towards Iris. “I’ve been expecting you.”\n\nThe old lady told Iris that she was a witch and had been watching her from the shadows for some time. She said that Iris had a special gift, and that she wanted to teach her how to use it. With the old witch’s help, Iris unlocked powerful magic within herself that she had never known she possessed.\n\nAfter a night of learning and wonder, Iris left the old house with her newfound knowledge and a newfound sense of confidence. From that day forward, she went on to do many amazing things in the world, all because she had discovered that mysterious note in her backyard."}]
