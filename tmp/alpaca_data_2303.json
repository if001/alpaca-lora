Born to a teacher and a principal, Marie showed an early interest in mathematics and physics and would go on to attend one of the few educational institutions in Europe at the time that allowed for women. Despite these barriers and the gender discrimination she faced in academia, Marie was able to make important contributions to the scientific fields and invent new techniques in radioactivity that earned her two Nobel Prizes. Marieâ€™s last years were spent advocating for women in science and also research in radiology. She passed away in 1934 due to aplastic anemia, which she is believed to have contracted from radiation she was exposed to in her research. Her legacy continues to live on, inspiring generations of scientists and women, who honor her courage, determination and groundbreaking discoveries."}, {"instruction": "Describe the life of a typical pre-school child in 200 words or less.", "input": "", "output": "For a typical preschool child, life is an exciting, carefree and playful journey full of discovery and learning opportunities.

As population size increases, the additional population growth rate increases due to the availability of resources. This is captured in an exponential curve, which shows a steeper rate of growth as the population size increases. Additionally, the rate of growth can be adjusted in an exponential model to better fit a population's growth. This allows for more accurate predictions of population growth and how it will vary in the future."}]
