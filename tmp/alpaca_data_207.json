Advances in technology have made it easier and more convenient to access knowledge and information, breaking down barriers that once limited access to information.

The increased use of technology has caused social isolation and a disconnection from reality. People donâ€™t need to interact with others face-to-face as much, which has weakened social interaction and inhibited real conversation. Additionally, as technology progresses, it is becoming increasingly difficult for individuals to keep up with the ever-changing technology and stay competitive in the job market. \n\nTechnology has had both positive and negative effects on society.
