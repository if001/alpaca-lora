Open-source software is available to view, edit and use by anyone with permission, and the code is distributed freely. Proprietary software is owned by the creator, and the code is kept secret. Open-source software is often developed by volunteers and supported by the open-source community, but proprietary software is developed and supported by the company owning the code. Open-source software has no costs associated with it and updates are often more frequent than proprietary software. However, open-source software can be vulnerable to malicious attacks and lack features usually found in proprietary software. Proprietary software typically runs faster and offers more features than open-source software, but it comes at the cost of being more expensive to obtain and maintain."}, {"instruction": "Generate a job description a programmer.", "input": "", "output": "We are looking for a experienced programmer to join our team.
