It is a special type of two-dimensional motion in which the object experiences constant acceleration due to the force of gravity. The path of the projectile is parabolic in nature, with the object forming the highest point of its trajectory called the apex. The parabolic path is known as a trajectory, and the maximum height reached by the projectile is called the maximum height. As the object falls, its speed decreases and it eventually lands on the ground."}, {"instruction": "Write a function to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius", "input": "", "output": "def F2C(F):\n    C = (F-32)*(5/9)\n    return C"}, {"instruction": "Compute the area of triangle from the given 3 sides", "input": "side1=3, side2=4, side3=5", "output": "6"}, {"instruction": "Prepare a statement of cash flows for the given business.", "input": "Net income: $ 7,500\nCash flow from operations: $1,200\nCash flow from investing: $2,100\nCash flow from financing: $3,200", "output": "Cash flow statement:\nNet increase in cash: $7,500\nCash flow from operations: $1,200\nCash flow from investing: $2,100\nCash flow from financing: $3,200\nNet cash flow: $6,500"}, {"instruction": "Summarize the given paragraph in two sentences.", "input": "David was born in 1980.
