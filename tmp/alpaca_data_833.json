The mutated genes can be replaced with healthy versions or missing genes can be added. The healthy genes are delivered to the cells via a carrier molecule called a vector. Viruses have historically been used as vectors but other options such as nanoparticles and lipid-based vectors are being explored. Once the healthy genes have been inserted, the products produced from those genes can then regulate and restore the normal function of cells. With gene therapy, the altered genes can be introduced into the cells of a patient, allowing them to make healthy proteins that will restore normal function and potentially reverse disease symptoms."}]
