There are three main areas of the ocean floor - the continental shelf, the continental slope, and the ocean floor. The continental shelf is the edge of the continent and is a shallow sea, usually no deeper than 650 feet. The continental slope is the steep decline that leads to the deep ocean, reaching depths of up to three miles. The ocean floor consists of plains and trenches, with the Mariana Trench being the deepest trench at over 11,000 meters deep. The ocean floor also contains ridges, which are large underwater mountain ranges that span thousands of miles."}, {"instruction": "Summarize the differences between a tomato and a watermelon.", "input": "", "output": "Tomatoes and watermelons are both fruits, but have distinct differences.

As it orbits the Earth, the moon's position changes every night. This means that the angle at which sunlight reflects off the moon changes and that the moon is illuminated differently, resulting in different looks on different nights.

Natural selection is the process by which individuals who are better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass on their traits to their offspring. This process leads to the formation of new species and allows for adaptation in a changing environment. \n\nIn addition, the theory of evolution explains how new genetic variations arise, how organisms acquire inherited traits, and how species diverge with time."}, {"instruction": "Brainstorm strategies to reduce food waste.", "input": "", "output": "Strategies to reduce food waste include proper food storage and preservation, educating consumers on portion sizes, using leftovers creatively, using recipes that use up food scraps, donating excess food to food banks, composting, and encouraging people to \"embrace the ugly vegetables\" by purchasing slightly imperfect produce."}, {"instruction": "Name three elements in the periodic table.", "input": "", "output": "Three elements in the periodic table are oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen."}, {"instruction": "Generate three questions that could be asked on computer science.", "input": "", "output": "What is the importance of Big O notation in computer science?\nWhat is the difference between an algorithm and a program? \nWhat is the role of artificial intelligence in computer science?"}, {"instruction": "Classify an input string as either a noun or a verb.", "input": "run", "output": "Verb."}, {"instruction": "Regroup the following words from lowest to highest based on their level of formality.", "input": "yelling, speaking, shouting", "output": "speaking, shouting, yelling"}, {"instruction": "Convert the following equation from infix notation to postfix notation.", "input": "3 + 4", "output": "3 4 +"}]
