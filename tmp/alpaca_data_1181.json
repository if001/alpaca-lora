Pawns can only move forward, and can be used to take out enemy pieces. Rooks can move in any direction and can take out enemy pieces. Knights can make an L-shaped movement on the board, and can take out enemy pieces. Bishops can move in any diagonal direction and can take out enemy pieces. The queen has the most mobility, able to move any distance in any straight line, and is considered the player's most powerful piece.
