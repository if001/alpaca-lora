Temperature increases resulting from climate change have the potential to cause droughts, floods, and other extreme weather conditions that can lead to water shortages, crop failures, and famine. Additionally, extreme weather events put more pressure on already stressed ecosystems, harming biodiversity and leading to more species becoming extinct. Climate change can also lead to rising sea levels that can displace millions of people from their homes and increase the risk of public health problems such as heat-related diseases and water-borne illnesses."}, {"instruction": "Compose a 5-line poem about heartbreak.", "input": "", "output": "Heartbreak so deep, it stains the soul  \nPain so heavy, it won't let go  \nNothing can fill the emptiness  \nLost in a darkness so bottomless  \nHeartache that wilts the very rose."}, {"instruction": "Put the following numbers in ascending order: 3,6,8,7,9", "input": "", "output": "3,6,7,8,9"}, {"instruction": "Design a data model to store customer information.", "input": "", "output": "The customer data model should include a customer table that stores customer name, address, contact details, customer type, purchasing history, and account status.
