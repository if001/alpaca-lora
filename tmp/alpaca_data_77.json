The process produces two daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell. It begins with the duplication of the chromosome, which occurs during interphase. During the prophase stage of mitosis, the chromosomes and the mitotic spindle condense and the nuclear membrane disintegrates. During metaphase, the chromosomes align on the metaphase plate. During anaphase, the chromosomes are pulled towards the poles of the cell, opposite to the center, and the sister chromatids are separated. Finally, during telophase, the nuclear membrane reforms and the chromosomes decondense. This completes the process of mitosis and the cell is divided into two daughter cells."}, {"instruction": "Generate a random pun.", "input": "", "output": "I watched a documentary on anchovies and it was pretty interesting - it was sprinkled with tons of fun facts!"}, {"instruction": "Classify the following animal as carnivore, herbivore, or omnivore.", "input": "Fox", "output": "The fox is an omnivore."}, {"instruction": "Write a character sketch of a villain in a story.", "input": "", "output": "The villain in the story is a mysterious figure cloaked in a long black robe.

Limited resources forced ancient civilizations to live conservatively, make decisions to maximize the use of their resources, and form alliances with other civilizations in order to use resources that were not available to them. This led to trade, which in turn increased the size of kingdoms and empires. Scarcity also created competition among groups of people, which led to conflict and war in some cases. As resources began to deplete, this could be a major factor in the decline of ancient civilizations."}, {"instruction": "Create a sentence with the given words.", "input": "Words: mad, music, bird", "output": "The mad music of the birds filled the air."}]
