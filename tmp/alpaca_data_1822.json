Draw a circle using point A as the center and a radius of half of the line segment, this will intersect the perpendicular line at a midpoint, C. Lastly, draw a line from point A to point C and from point B to point C.

Cut in 1/2 cup of cold butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add 4 tablespoons cold water and stir everything together. Knead the dough lightly and form it into a ball. Roll the dough onto a lightly floured surface so that it's about 2 inches larger than the pie plate. Place the dough into the plate and press it down lightly. Trim the edges and set aside.\n\nTo make the filling, mix 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup flour and 1 teaspoon cinnamon in a large bowl. Peel, core and slice 4 medium apples and add them to the bowl. Toss the apples until they are evenly coated and then pour them into the pie crust. Dot the top of the apples with 2 tablespoons of butter and set aside.\n\nTo make the top crust, cut the remaining dough into strips. Lay the strips across the top of the pie in a lattice pattern. Crimp the edges of the crust to seal. Bake the pie at 375°F for 45-50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.
