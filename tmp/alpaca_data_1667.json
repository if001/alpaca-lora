The two main concepts of the theory are relativity of motion and equality of inertial frames. In other words, the laws of physics must be the same in all reference frames including frames that are accelerating, and any physical event occurs the same for all observers regardless of the observer's state of motion. Additionally, the theory states that the speed of light is constant in any inertial frame. Einstein's work implies that time and space are curved, and that gravity is an effect of this curvature."}, {"instruction": "What is a priority queue?", "input": "", "output": "A priority queue is a data structure where items are stored in an order according to the priority assigned to them. It works by assigning a priority to each item that is added to the queue. The item with the highest priority is removed from the queue first, followed by the item with the next highest priority, and so on. This makes it useful for ordering tasks according to their importance."}, {"instruction": "Name the benefits of using OAuth.", "input": "", "output": "OAuth is a secure open standard for authorization.

CNNs are best suited for tasks such as computer vision, while RNNs are best suited for tasks such as natural language processing. Another key difference between CNNs and RNNs is their structure: CNNs have multiple layers of convolutional filters while RNNs have layers of recurrent modules."}, {"instruction": "Explain the operational steps for back-propagation in a neural network.", "input": "", "output": "Back-propagation is an important component of learning in neural networks. The operational steps for back-propagation involve propagating the errors from the output layer back to the input layer, through each of the hidden layers. The error is then used to adjust the weights in the network to reduce error and improve the performance of the model. First, the errors are calculated at the output layer, then back propagated through the network to determine the error at the input layer. Then, the weights of the network are updated using the calculated errors. This process is repeated until the model converges to its optimal state."}, {"instruction": "Given the following string, find the number of substrings containing the letter \"m\"?", "input": "comfortable", "output": "There are 3 substrings containing the letter 'm': com, fortab, and mble."}, {"instruction": "How do you convert 18 Celsius to Fahrenheit?", "input": "", "output": "18 Celsius is equal to 64.4 Fahrenheit."}]
