While they share a passion for nature and a fascination with colors, their artistic styles could not be more different. Vincent Van Gogh’s work is characterized by his use of vivid colors and expressive brushwork, as seen in his works such as The Starry Night. Jackson Pollock, on the other hand, was more interested in creating abstract works of art with an emphasis on gesture and spontaneity, most famously expressed in his drip paintings. While both artists have had a lasting impact on the art world, their style and approach are distinctly different."}, {"instruction": "Describe the characteristics of the new smart television.", "input": "", "output": "The new smart television has a number of characteristics that make it stand out from other televisions.
