[{"instruction": "Explain the advantages the of using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).", "input": "", "output": "The main advantage of using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) over other types of neural networks is its ability to capture patterns in data, such as images or video scenes, which can be very difficult for a regular neural network. By utilizing convolutional layers, which extract features from the input data, a CNN can achieve better accuracy in certain tasks such as image or video recognition, or object detection. Additionally, CNNs are able to capture spatial relationships in data, as well as temporal relationships in video sequences, which further increases their accuracy. Additionally, CNNs are much more computationally efficient than their counterparts, as they use fewer parameters and require less training time."}, {"instruction": "Write a question that asks for personal information.", "input": "", "output": "What is your address and telephone number?"}, {"instruction": "Create a list of steps on how to write a literature review.", "input": "", "output": "1.
