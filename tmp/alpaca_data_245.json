[{"instruction": "Name five everyday activities that involve physics.", "input": "", "output": "Five everyday activities that involve physics are: throwing a ball, riding a bicycle, walking down the stairs, talking, and swinging a pendulum. Throwing a ball involves understanding how the forces of gravity, inertia, and acceleration work together. Riding a bicycle involves understanding how energy is transferred to the pedals and wheels through friction. Walking down the stairs requires understanding how releasing energy alters an object's momentum. Talking involves understanding how sound waves travel through the air. Finally, swinging a pendulum involves understanding how energy is transferred from the center of gravity to the pendulum."}, {"instruction": "Construct a query to find all customers from a certain date range.", "input": "Table: customers", "output": "SELECT * FROM customers WHERE date BETWEEN '<start date>' AND '<end date>'"}, {"instruction": "Design a strategy for developing artificial intelligence.", "input": "", "output": "A strategy for developing artificial intelligence should include several components.
