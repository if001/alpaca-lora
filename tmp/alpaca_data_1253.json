Algorithmic Opacity - AI systems can be too complex to understand and interpret, making it difficult to assess whether the outcomes of AI systems are fair and just. \n4. Automation of Human Bias - AI systems may replicate human biases, prejudices and discrimination. \n5. Lack of AI Understanding - If humans do not have enough understanding of the inner workings of an AI system, they may be unable to identify and rectify any errors. \n6. Job Loss - Automation powered by AI may lead to job losses, particularly in fields like manufacturing.\n7. Security Risks - AI systems may be vulnerable to security breaches, either through malicious humans or malicious systems. \n8. Unintended Consequences - AI systems may produce unintended consequences and behaviors that were not anticipated.\n9.
