[{"instruction": "Compose a short critique of the following artwork.", "input": "https://www.moma.org/collection/works/814", "output": "This is a piece by the artist Yayoi Kusama titled \"Obliteration Room\". It is a work of installation art and features a space painted entirely white with colorful polka dots and multicolored stickers applied to its surfaces. The work is a collaboration with children from the Kids Club of Melbourne who add to the artwork with their colorful stickers that cover the white walls. The overall feeling of the piece is playful and whimsical, but it also has a hint of melancholia in its exploration of the process of obliteration. The colors of the stickers create a unique effect that, in a way, symbolize the human experience of growth, change and eventual completion. Overall, this artwork is a wonderful representation of Yayoi Kusama's signature style and a great reminder to celebrate the beauty of the present moment."}, {"instruction": "Imagine you are a tourist in Rome, what would be your favorite sights?", "input": "", "output": "My favorite sights in Rome would be the Colosseum, the Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, Saint Peter's Basilica and the Roman Forum.

Although both cities are influenced by Spain’s rich culture, there are distinct differences between them. One of the main differences between Granada and Madrid is the atmosphere; Granada is a small and peaceful city, known for its Moorish architecture and historical sites, while Madrid is larger and livelier, with modern skyscrapers, impressive landmarks and bustling nightlife. Another difference between Granada and Madrid is their cuisine; Granada is traditionally known for its tapas and eclectic flavors, while Madrid has more traditional Spanish food, such as paellas and tortillas. The language spoken in Granada tends to be more equivalent to Andalusian Spanish, while Madrid has a stronger Castilian accent. Finally, Granada is proud to have its own flamenco dance style, while Madrid does not.  All of these cultural differences make Granada and Madrid distinct and unique places to visit."}, {"instruction": "Find one historical event in the 15th century (1400s) and describe it briefly.", "input": "", "output": "In the 15th century, there was an event that had a major impact on the world - the fall of Constantinople.

Countries that have absolute advantage are able to produce more goods or services for the same amount of resources than other countries. For example, if a country can produce 10 widgets with 20 hours of labor, while another country can only produce 8 widgets with 20 hours of labor, the first country would have an absolute advantage in widget production. This concept of absolute advantage helps countries and companies identify their competitive advantages and understand how best to use their resources in order to stay competitive."}, {"instruction": "Create an email marketing campaign to promote a new product.", "input": "", "output": "Subject: Introducing our brand new product! \n\nDear [Name], \n\nWe are excited to announce the launch of our brand new product, [Product Name].
