On the other hand, online retailers have seen a surge in sales since the start of the pandemic as more consumers have embraced e-commerce as a viable option for everyday shopping. This shift in purchasing behavior has likely led to a permanent change in the way consumers do their shopping and has necessitated that traditional retail stores look towards differentiating themselves in order to remain competitive with online retailers."}]
