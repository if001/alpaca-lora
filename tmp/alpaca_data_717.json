She cautiously stepped closer, and out jumped a white rabbit wearing a tiny red vest with gold buttons and a fancy top hat! The rabbit started talking to Sarah, telling her that he was a kindly wizard who had been wandering the woods, looking to help someone in need.  He offered to take her home and so, Sarah followed the wizard deep into the woods, growing more and more confused as to how she will ever find her way home.\n\nBut the wizard had a plan! He opened his wand and cast a powerful spell, creating a magical bridge over the seemingly endless labyrinth of trees. Sarah gasped in amazement, and followed the wizard across the bridge until they spotted her house in the distance.\n\nAs they reached Sarah's home, the wizard turned to her and said, “If ever you’re lost in the woods again, remember that you only need believe in yourself and you will find your way home.” With a wave of his wand, he disappeared into the night.\n\nSarah was home safe, thanks to the help of the kindly wizard.
