AI systems can leverage large datasets of medical information, such as medical history, patient symptoms, and laboratory results, to identify potential illnesses more accurately and quickly than if done manually. AI use also accelerates drug development, providing pharmaceutical companies with an automated way to identify potential drug targets, design and create drugs, and predict drug responses. AI also has the potential to revolutionize preventive care by detecting diseases early and helping physicians to plan a more appropriate treatment plan. Furthermore, AI-powered robots are being used to assist in surgical procedures, providing surgeons with greater precision and accuracy.
