During training, the neural network is exposed to various inputs and their known outputs. Each time the neural network gets an input, it modifies its weights and bias values to try and get as close as possible to the expected output. The weights and bias values are updated after each iteration of the training process until the network is able to accurately predict the outcomes for inputs it has never seen before."}, {"instruction": "Describe how social media has changed society.", "input": "", "output": "Social media has drastically changed how people interact and communicate with one another.
