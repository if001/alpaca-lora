During this time the Soviet government implemented numerous state-sponsored social and economic programs, drastically changing the political, economic, and social systems of the USSR. \n\nThe fall of the Iron Curtain began in the late 1980s, with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact in 1989. This event marked the end of the Cold War and a radical shift in the international order. It signified the end of Soviet hegemony in Eastern Europe, and with it the end of the ideological and physical divisions between East and West put in place during the Cold War. \n\nThe two events had a significant impact on the global geopolitical balance, with the rise of the Soviet Union representing a major shift in the international order and the fall of the Iron Curtain marking a decisive end to the Cold War and a transition to a new era of international relationship."}, {"instruction": "Classify the following animal as either extinct or endangered.", "input": "Pygmy three-toed sloth", "output": "The Pygmy three-toed sloth is classified as an endangered species.
