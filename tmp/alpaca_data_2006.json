The absence of animal products in a plant-based diet provides essential nutrients that are essential for maintaining good health. By omitting animal products, the body can no longer be exposed to the high levels of fats and cholesterol found in processed meats, dairy and eggs. Additionally, plant-based dietary patterns yield lower levels of saturated fat, sodium, and refined carbohydrates than those of diets that include animal proteins. Plant-based diets are also associated with a wide range of health benefits from improving cardiovascular function to reducing the risk of certain types of cancer. Even more, a plant-based diet helps in the fight against climate change, as it reduces emissions from animal agriculture, one of the largest sources of human-caused emissions. Therefore, switching to a plant-based diet is not only a healthy choice for the body, but it also helps protect our environment. A plant-based diet can lead to a healthier and more sustainable world."}]
