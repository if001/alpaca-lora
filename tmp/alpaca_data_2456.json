When a gas is compressed, it requires work to be done against it, which adds energy to it and raises its temperature. Reducing the pressure of the gas also has the effect of decreasing its temperature. Finally, cooling the walls of the container in which the gas is contained can decrease the temperature of the gas."}, {"instruction": "Make a list of some countries in the Commonwealth of Nations.", "input": "", "output": "Some countries in the Commonwealth of Nations are: 1.
