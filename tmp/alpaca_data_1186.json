It propagates through space, transferring energy from one location to another. The wave travels at the speed of light in a vacuum, which is roughly 3.00 x 10^8 meters per second. As it moves, the wave can be absorbed by objects or reflected back by them. When passing through matter, the wave can also be scattered by particles in the medium. This scattering can reduce the energy of the wave and thus the intensity of the electromagnetic radiation. It can also affect the frequency of the wave, resulting in a change in the color of the light. In general, electromagnetic waves can travel in a straight line or in curved paths, depending on the structure of the medium it is passing through."}, {"instruction": "Summarize the differences between a debit and credit card", "input": "", "output": "Debit and credit cards are both payment methods with many similarities, but there are important differences between the two. Debit cards are linked to a checking account and allow you to make payments directly from your account balance. Credit cards, on the other hand, allow you to borrow money up to an established credit limit and pay it off in installments.  Credit card payments typically incur an interest charge, while debit card purchases are not subject to interest. Credit cards often provide rewards and other special benefits, while debit cards do not. Finally, debit cards are generally accepted by fewer merchants than credit cards."}, {"instruction": "Brainstorm a few ideas for a conflict in a novel", "input": "", "output": "- Two rival families vying for control of a small town\n- A scientist on the run after discovering a revolutionary power source\n- Two countries at war over limited resources\n- A detective investigating a mysterious murder\n- A teenage girl caught between her parents' conflicting beliefs\n- Friends divided by different political ideologies\n- A friendship tested by an unethical business decision\n- A love triangle between two close friends and a newcomer\n- A parent struggling to protect their child from a dangerous cult"}, {"instruction": "Identify the main elements of setting in a story", "input": "", "output": "The main elements of setting in a story are time, place, and atmosphere.
