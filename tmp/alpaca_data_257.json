The clouds move and finally, when the conditions are right, the clouds release the water in the form of precipitation, such as rain or snow, which then returns to the earth's surface. The water then begins the cycle once again."}, {"instruction": "How can companies use artificial intelligence (AI) to increase their profits?", "input": "", "output": "Companies can use artificial intelligence (AI) to increase their profits by leveraging data-driven insights to make better decisions.
