Schools that offer PE classes give students the opportunity to be active and stay fit, thus reducing the risk of long-term illnesses such as heart disease, diabetes and obesity. It is also a great way for students to learn about their own physical capabilities, develop confidence and gain team building skills. Furthermore, PE classes can be used to introduce students to different sports and activities that they may not have the opportunity to try otherwise. This can help teach skills such as problem solving and provide an avenue for students to pursue a lifelong interest in physical activities. Therefore, it is clear that offering PE classes in schools brings many benefits and should be encouraged."}, {"instruction": "Provide several examples of sound effects.", "input": "", "output": "Examples of sound effects include door slams, footsteps, gunshots, car tyre screeches, fire crackles, bird chirps, thunder rumbles, and ocean waves crashing."}, {"instruction": "Create a list of elements that would contribute to success in a job.", "input": "", "output": "Elements that contribute to success in a job include skill and expertise in the field, a solid work ethic, a positive attitude and work ethic, time management skills, problem-solving abilities, the ability to collaborate and communicate effectively with colleagues, and a flexible mindset that allows for adapting to changing work environments."}, {"instruction": "Explain a natural phenomenon.", "input": "Auroras", "output": "Auroras are beautiful lights seen in the night sky in places near the Earth's magnetic poles.
