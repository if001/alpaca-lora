We would also perform feature engineering to identify the most powerful features which reliably sink with the price behavior. After that, we would train the model with different neural network models like shallow nn, deep nn, and recurrent nn. On top of the neural network models, hyperparameter tuning should be performed in order to further optimize the models.
