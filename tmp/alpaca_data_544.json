In NLP, it is often difficult to obtain labeled data in a language of interest, due to limited resources. With self-supervised learning, machines can learn from the structure of text without needing labels. This is beneficial because machines can learn the inherent features and structure of language which can then be used for tasks like text classification and sentiment analysis."}, {"instruction": "What is the best value for the hyperparameter gamma in SVM?", "input": "", "output": "The best value for the hyperparameter gamma in Support Vector Machines (SVM) depends on the type of problem and the data used. Generally, it is recommended to start with a low value, typically in the range of 0.1 to 0.001, and then adjust it incrementally according to the results. Tuning the hyperparameter correctly allows SVM models to better detect complex nonlinear relations in the data."}, {"instruction": "Edit the sentence for improved readability.", "input": "The recent lockdown period forced people to stay inside so as to limit the spread of the virus", "output": "The recent lockdown period forced people to remain indoors in order to limit the spread of the virus."}, {"instruction": "What is one use case for speech recognition technology?", "input": "", "output": "One use case for speech recognition technology is voice-controlled user interfaces.
