Above the troposphere is an inversion layer that is at a surprisingly high temperature of around -30 degrees Celsius. The stratosphere is much colder, with temperatures dropping to around -150 degrees Celsius at 200 km. Above the stratosphere is the mesosphere, which acts as a buffer between the stratosphere and the thermosphere and extends out to around 500 km where temperatures can reach around 1,000 degrees Celsius. Lastly, the thermosphere is the outermost zone of the atmosphere and is composed of layers of ionized particles that can reach temperatures well above 1,000 degrees Celsius.\n//EOM//"}, {"instruction": "Generate a random number from 1 to 10.", "input": "", "output": "6."}, {"instruction": "List three accomplishments of Marie Curie.", "input": "", "output": "Marie Curie's accomplishments include the discovery of a new chemical element, development of the theory of radioactivity, and pioneering research in the field of X-ray technology."}, {"instruction": "With respect to the provided input, provide a creative solution that maximizes the efficiency.", "input": "A factory produces an average of 500 chairs per day.", "output": "The factory could optimize production efficiency by introducing automation such as robotic assembly lines and programmable machines.
