He looked around his bedroom, but there was no one there. Then he heard the voice again, begging him to follow it.\n\nFilled with curiosity and determination, Jake followed the voice, heading deeper and deeper into the forest.

The impossible had happened - it was a tree that grew coins, dollars, and even gems.\n\nUnable to believe his luck, Jake started filling his pockets with the precious items he found around the tree. But just as he was about to leave, a fierce creature stepped out of the darkness. \n\nJake scrambled away, only to find the creature had transformed into the mysterious voice he heard earlier. It turns out, the voice was actually a spell cast by an evil witch who was trying to trap people with her illusions. \n\nLuckily Jake was smart and brave, and he was able to outsmart the witch and escape with his life and treasures. From that day on, Jake's life was never the same again."}]
