It was covered in a thick layer of dust, carefully bound in worn, brown leather. She pulled the book off the shelf and saw that it had no title or author, a fact that immediately piqued her curiosity. \n\nCurious, she carefully opened the pages of the book and discovered a hand-crafted journal filled with detailed descriptions of places, people and events that were different from anything she had ever read before. She could tell, from careful observation, that the journal had been written by a man who lived several centuries before and that his observations had been extremely accurate. \n\nAnne was ultimately able to track down the journal's origin and discovered that the man who wrote it had been missing for centuries. She became renowned among historians for her work, and the journal itself eventually went on to become an important research resource for many in the field. \n\nAnne discovered that sometimes, old books can hide a great deal more than dusty stories."}, {"instruction": "How would you solve this math problem?", "input": "8x + 6 = 52", "output": "x = 6"}, {"instruction": "Which of the following two poem excerpts has the best meter?", "input": "Excerpt 1: Alone, so lonely, I sit upon the shore\nExcerpt 2: A creature lived below, slowly forgotten and unheard", "output": "Excerpt 1 has the best meter."}, {"instruction": "Generate an example of a person whose ambition is to become a successful entrepreneur.", "input": "", "output": "John is a 24-year-old college graduate from rural Michigan.
