Organic food is also higher in vitamins, minerals, and overall nutrition than non-organic food. In addition, organic food is often produced closer to the source and may spend less time in transit, making it more nutrient-rich and fresher than non-organic food. On the other hand, non-organic food tends to be cheaper, faster to produce, and more widely available since it is not restricted to certain practices. While there is debate about whether organic food is really any healthier for you, there is a general consensus that it is better for the environment and more sustainable than non-organic food production."}, {"instruction": "Describe a potential problem with using AI for job recruitment.", "input": "", "output": "One potential problem with using AI for job recruitment is the potential for bias in the models.
