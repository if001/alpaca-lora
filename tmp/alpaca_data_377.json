[{"instruction": "Explain what the Big-O notation means in computer science.", "input": "", "output": "In computer science, Big-O notation is used to describe the performance of an algorithm— specifically the worst case number of operations required to execute the algorithm. Big-O notation assigns a letter \"O\" to a function that describes the growth rate of its execution time. The number of operations is then classified according to how quickly it grows in terms of the input size. Big-O notation is often used to compare different algorithms to see which one is faster."}, {"instruction": "Given a sentence, generate a paraphrase of the sentence that is 8 to 10 words in length.", "input": "John quickly ran to the store.", "output": "John hastened to the store."}, {"instruction": "Categorize the following song by its genre.", "input": "Moth To A Flame by Zayde Wolf", "output": "Genre: Electropop"}, {"instruction": "Convert the descripion of the following animal into a sentence", "input": "Description: A large grey cat with stripes.", "output": "The animal is a large, grey cat with stripes."}, {"instruction": "For the following movie, what is the main moral value?", "input": "Movie: The Princess Bride", "output": "The main moral value of The Princess Bride is loyalty."}, {"instruction": "Pick one action from each of the following categories, and combine the actions into one sentence.", "input": "Categories: Sports, Occupations, Cooking", "output": "The coach baked a cake while refereeing a game of basketball."}, {"instruction": "What is the difference between a regular expression (RegEx) and a wildcard using in programming language?", "input": "", "output": "Regular expressions are a sequence of characters used to match a pattern in a string.

Elmer was always the most gentle and kind of his friends, and he was always helpful whenever his friends needed something. One day, Elmer's friends decided to have a race. Elmer was the one who won, but he was too shy to tell anyone that he had won. However, his friends knew that Elmer had won and they cheered for him! Elmer was so happy and proud of himself. That was the best day ever for Elmer!"}, {"instruction": "What is a neural network and how does it work?", "input": "", "output": "A neural network is a type of machine learning algorithm that can be used to recognize patterns in data. It is made up of interconnected nodes (also known as “neurons”). Each node is connected to each other and forms a network. The neural network receives an input which is processed in order to derive an output. The input is multiplied by a weight and then passed through a non-linear activation function. The output is then compared to the desired output in order to determine the accuracy of the neural network and identify areas for improvement."}, {"instruction": "Create a dataset of the top 10 universities in the world.", "input": "", "output": "Rank, Name, Country\n\n1, Harvard University, United States \n2, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), United States\n3, Stanford University, United States \n4, University of Oxford, United Kingdom \n5, California Institute of Technology (Caltech), United States \n6, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom\n7, Princeton University, United States \n8, University of California, Berkeley, United States\n9, Columbia University, United States \n10, University of California, Los Angeles, United States"}, {"instruction": "Write a query to find all words that start with the letter 'd'.", "input": "", "output": "SELECT word FROM table_name\nWHERE word LIKE 'd%'"}, {"instruction": "How can the world reduce its carbon emissions?", "input": "", "output": "The world can reduce its carbon emissions by investing in clean energy technologies such as renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydropower.
