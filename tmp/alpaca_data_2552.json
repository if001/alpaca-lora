This effect is caused by the law of conservation of energy; when a source of waves and an observer move towards each other, the frequency seen by the observer is increased, while when they move away from each other the frequency seen is decreased. This effect is commonly seen in sound and light waves, leading to a change in pitch heard or a change in the color of light seen."}, {"instruction": "Determine the best option for investment.", "input": "I have $20,000 and I want to invest in stocks.", "output": "It is recommended to diversify your investments for optimal returns and less risk.

This process is important for producing the oxygen that we need to breathe as well as storing energy for the plant to use. The process takes place in the chloroplasts, which are specialized organelles in the plant. During photosynthesis, light energy is absorbed and broken down, and the resulting energy is then used to convert carbon dioxide into oxygen and organic compounds such as glucose. Water is also needed for the process and is usually taken up from the roots. The energy stored in the glucose molecules is then used by the plant to grow and create new cells."}, {"instruction": "Identify which of these objects is not a mineral.", "input": "Garnet, Gold, Ceramic", "output": "Ceramic is not a mineral."}, {"instruction": "Create a Python script that will calcuate the average of three numbers.", "input": "", "output": "def calculate_average(num1, num2, num3):\n    return (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3"}, {"instruction": "Given a list of elements, find the longest increasing sequence in the array", "input": "5, 4, 3, 2, 7, 6, 1", "output": "3, 2, 7, 6"}, {"instruction": "Given a sentence, delete any repeated words and make the sentence grammatically correct.", "input": "This movie movie was so bad bad,", "output": "This movie was so bad,"}, {"instruction": "Create a joke by combining two peopleâ€™s names.", "input": "Anthony and Mark", "output": "What do you call a joint venture between Anthony and Mark?
