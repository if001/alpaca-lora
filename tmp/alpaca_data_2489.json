These contracts are created by union negotiations between police management and local governments, and dictate the terms of work, pay, and discipline.

Critics claim that the contracts block accountability and reform efforts, as well as protect officers accused of misconduct. Despite calls to revisit these contracts, the process is slow and laborious. Police reform activists hope that large-scale mobilization may put the pressure needed to reform these contracts and make a change in police practices."}, {"instruction": "Design a logo for a bakery based on provided details.", "input": "The bakery’s name is “Noxious Treats” and they specialize in desserts.", "output": "No Output"}, {"instruction": "Given two different styles of product descriptions, which one is likely to get more clicks?", "input": "Option 1:\nThis summer tank is a perfect addition for your casual wardrobe.
