Cloud computing provides access to computing power, software, and storage resources on an on-demand basis, allowing users to scale up instantly in response to changing demand.\n\nThe ability to access and use computing services from any device with an internet connection has dramatically changed the way we can experience and use technology. Businesses can reduce the costs associated with purchasing and maintaining their own data centers and instead leverage existing cloud computing resources. In addition, cloud computing allows businesses to focus more on generating meaningful insights from data instead of worrying about the underlying infrastructure.\n\nCloud computing also has the advantage of allowing for data storage that is secure, reliable, and available at any time. Companies no longer need to manage each individual piece of hardware and instead can focus on scalability and agility. Cloud computing helps businesses expand without huge investments in hardware and allows IT teams to quickly scale applications to meet the needs of the business.\n\nFinally, cloud computing helps companies reduce their impact on the environment as they no longer need to purchase hardware that requires a lot of energy to run. Cloud computing makes it possible to utilize computing power without needing to maintain a hardware infrastructure, saving energy that would otherwise have been expended generating and storing data."}, {"instruction": "Create a sentence in Simple Present and another sentence in Simple Past using the verb 'walk'.", "input": "", "output": "Simple Present: I walk to the store every day.\nSimple Past: Yesterday, I walked to the store."}, {"instruction": "Calculate the total calories of the suggested breakfast.", "input": "1/2 cup oatmeal, 60 grams whey protein powder, 1/2 medium banana, 1tbsp flaxseed oil and 1/2 cup watter", "output": "The total calories of the suggested breakfast is 550 calories."}]
