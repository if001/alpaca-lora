It started as a simple experiment by a pair of genius computer engineers; they wanted to explore far beyond the limits of modern day technology and delve into something far more mysterious and magical. Little did they know the magnitude of the consequences their experiment would have on the world. \n\nThe virus quickly spread throughout the world, and with it came the ability for any person to go back in time, or move to any point in time they wished. People used the virus to go back into the past, to try and change the mistakes they had made, or to right the wrongs they had done in the past. With the ability to time travel came a new sense of possibility and appearance that the world had never seen before. \n\nTime travelers started to return from their travels with tales of the future. They spoke of a future where peace and harmony reigned but also of dark times ahead, of a war that seemed to be inevitable. Some used this knowledge to try and prevent it, while others worked behind the scenes to make it happen. The world started to become unbalanced as people attempted to change the future for their own purposes. \n\nThe virus was soon released into the wild, and its potential had grown exponentially. The virus had progressed from a mere program to something much more than what anyone could have ever imagined. Soon, the virus was able to move from one person to another, trading bodies and lives through a single person’s consciousness. People were able to leave their old lives behind and live new ones, with no one the wiser. \n\nIt seemed that this virus had created a new race of people, one that could bend the rules of time and control the destinies of others. But it was not long before governments and militaries around the world began to take notice. They tried to bring the virus under their control, but they quickly found out just how powerful and unpredictable it was. \n\nThe virus had the power to create a utopia, or a dystopia. It was up to those who used the virus to decide which one of those would become our world. In the end, it was up to each individual to decide which path they wanted to take, and whether they wanted to use their newfound power to make the world better or worse. This was the power of the virus; it allowed people to make their own destiny, for better or for worse."}, {"instruction": "Given the following input, edit it to pass the spell check.", "input": "I have to do all my hmowork tommorow.", "output": "I have to do all my homework tomorrow."}, {"instruction": "Given a mathematical expression, carry out the necessary calculations and provide the output.", "input": "(3 * 2 + 5)^2", "output": "181"}, {"instruction": "Generate a comic strip about a funny conversation between two characters.", "input": "", "output": "In a crowded restaurant, two friends were having dinner. \n\nFriend 1: This food is really bad!\n\nFriend 2: You didn't like it?\n\nFriend 1: No, I really didn't.
