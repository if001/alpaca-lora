Templating languages allow developers to separate their code into distinct layers of presentation and data processing, making it easier to maintain their code long-term. Templating languages can also provide greater flexibility, as developers can use conditional logic to generate different output based on user input or other variables. Additionally, templating languages often include features like the ability to reuse components, which can make building websites or applications faster and simpler, and code-editing features, which can make code more accessible and easier to debug."}, {"instruction": "Create at least 3 test cases for this function.", "input": "def calculate_area(length, width):\n    return length * width", "output": "Test Case 1:\nInput: Length = 5, Width = 8\nExpected Output: 40\n\nTest Case 2:\nInput: Length = 10, Width = 10\nExpected Output: 100\n\nTest Case 3:\nInput: Length = 0, Width = 3\nExpected Output: 0"}, {"instruction": "Suggest a debugging strategy for identifying the bug in the following code.", "input": "def say_hello():\n    print(\"Hello world!\")\n    print(\"Goodbye world\")", "output": "A debugging strategy for identifying the bug in the code could be to use a print statement at the end of the function to print out what the return value is.

Online stores typically eliminate the need for a customer to travel to the store, whereas a brick-and-mortar store requires a customer to physically enter the store in order to purchase goods. Additionally, online stores normally have access to a much larger range of products due to the amount of vendors who are able to list and ship goods worldwide, whereas a brick-and-mortar store may only have access to goods from certain locations or from certain vendors."}, {"instruction": "Convert this length measurement from feet to meters.", "input": "32 feet", "output": "32 feet is equal to 9.75 meters."}, {"instruction": "Identify the key pieces of evidence that support the conclusion.", "input": "The article concludes that the new law will increase the risk of poverty.", "output": "The key pieces of evidence that support the conclusion are the statistics presented in the article that show an increase in unemployment, an increase in the number of people dependent on government aid, and a decrease in median wages post-law enactment."}, {"instruction": "Explain the implications of the increased demand for fossil fuels.", "input": "", "output": "The increased demand for fossil fuels has several implications.
