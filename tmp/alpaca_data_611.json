[{"instruction": "Explain the anatomy of a bicycle.", "input": "", "output": "The anatomy of a bicycle consists of a frame, two wheels, handlebars, pedals, a seat, and brakes. The frame is the skeletal structure that holds all of the other components together and supports the rider's weight. The two wheels are positioned parallel to each other and are connected to the frame by axles. Handlebars are used for balance and for steering the bike. Pedals are connected to the bottom of the frame and the rider uses their feet to propel the bike forward. The seat is connected to the frame and is adjustable to the rider's height. The brakes are usually attached to either the handlebars or pedals, and are used to stop the bike."}, {"instruction": "How would you classify this sentence? \"I love to play soccer.\"", "input": "", "output": "The sentence \"I love to play soccer\" can be classified as an imperative statement."}, {"instruction": "Find three examples of British English slang.", "input": "", "output": "Three examples of British English slang are: \"as happy as a sandboy\" (very happy), \"blooming larst\" (very angry), and \"bostin\" (excellent)."}, {"instruction": "Edit this sentence: \"You've done such a great job.\"", "input": "", "output": "You have done an outstanding job!"}, {"instruction": "You are in charge of designing a company logo.

First, the API must be designed to meet the needs and expected use-cases. This includes mapping out data structures, endpoints, and expected interactions between clients and the API. Next, the API data and operations must be exposed with the proper URL schema, HTTP methods, and API verbs. This information should be laid out in a well-defined API specification or documentation. After the API has been designed it must be implemented on a development or production-ready server, depending on the user’s needs. This requires configuring the server environment and applying the appropriate security measures for any data or operations normally exposed to the public. Finally, the API must be tested to ensure both functional and non-functional requirements are met. This includes testing every endpoint and automated testing of certain scenarios and edge cases. Once the tests have been completed the API can be deployed and released to the public."}, {"instruction": "Generate a creative and challenging game.", "input": "", "output": "A creative and challenging game is Rock, Paper, Glue.
