The rise in population can lead to a spike in the demand for public transport, which can create delays, overcrowding, and inefficiencies in the system. This can lead to longer commute times and higher costs for users of the network, as well as reduce their overall satisfaction with the system. To combat this, cities must invest heavily in public transport infrastructure and services in order to provide reliable, efficient and accessible solutions for increasing urban densities."}, {"instruction": "Classify the consumer sentiment toward a particular brand of car.", "input": "Brand of car: Tesla", "output": "The consumer sentiment towards Tesla cars is generally very positive.
