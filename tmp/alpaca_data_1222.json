Unlike traditional computing, neural networks can process a variety of inputs and respond accordingly, making them superior for complex tasks such as image and voice recognition. Neural networks are also capable of generalizing well; they can take a small amount of data and recognize patterns that then apply to larger data sets. Additionally, neural networks are more robust and able to handle noisy data without getting confused. Finally, artificial neural networks are fast, can process data in parallel and require little computational resources."}, {"instruction": "Please explain in three sentences how a GPS navigation system works.", "input": "", "output": "A GPS navigation system uses satellites to detect its location.
