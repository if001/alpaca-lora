Capitalism is based around the idea of a market economy, where individuals and firms make decisions about production and purchase based on prices and profit maximization. On the other hand, communism is based around the idea of a planned economy where resources are mainly allocated by the government. Both systems strive to regulate the economy and influence its growth, though they have starkly different methods."}, {"instruction": "Name 3 products that Apple Inc is famous for", "input": "", "output": "Apple Inc is famous for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac computer."}, {"instruction": "Read the given paragraph and find the main theme", "input": "In baseball, home-run hitting has been much more difficult in the past few decades, due to the ball being harder, as well as the transformation of stadiums after 1988 to favor pitching.", "output": "The main theme of the paragraph is that hitting home runs has become more difficult in recent years because of the changes in the ball and stadium design."}, {"instruction": "Please describe the current government of India", "input": "", "output": "India is a federal parliamentary republic governed under the Constitution of India.

For example, it can be trained to generate stories based on given prompts, generate music, create detailed answers to questions, and complete the unfinished tasks."}, {"instruction": "What is the basic idea behind GPT models?", "input": "", "output": "GPT models are based on the idea of using a neural network to generate natural language output. They use large datasets of example text to learn patterns in the data, and then apply these patterns to generate new text. In the most basic form, the GPT model takes an input and outputs a sentence that is related to the input. However, GPT models can also be trained to generate longer text, such as stories and articles, by using a repeated input/output loop."}, {"instruction": "Classify the following passage as either informative or persuasive", "input": "The government has implemented new restrictions in order to contain the spread of the virus.", "output": "Informative."}, {"instruction": "How can GPT models be used to improve digital assistant bots?", "input": "", "output": "GPT models can be used to improve digital assistant bots by enabling them to understand and respond to natural language input more accurately.
