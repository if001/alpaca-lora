[{"instruction": "Design an animation showing the process of photosynthesis.", "input": "", "output": "The animation should begin with the sun shining, followed by energy-storing molecules called chloroplasts appearing. The chloroplasts act as tiny factories which turn sunlight into energy, while also taking in water and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The energy is then used to create sugars, which are stored in the plant as fuel. The animation should show this energy transformation process, followed by the plant releasing oxygen into the atmosphere as a by-product."}, {"instruction": "Describe the impacts of climate change on communities living in coastal areas.", "input": "", "output": "Climate change has caused an increase in sea levels, which has caused coastal erosion and flooding of low-lying areas.

It is commonly used in machine learning and statistics to estimate the skill of a model on unseen data. It involves splitting the data into k-folds (usually 5 or 10) and each fold is tested using a different combination of the features from the training set. This helps to identify the most accurate combination of features and avoids overfitting the model. Cross-validation allows for a more accurate prediction of the model performance on unseen test data, which is why it is important for ensuring a higher quality and accuracy of the model."}, {"instruction": "Given a passage and two intents, output the probability of the passage belonging to each intent.", "input": "The weather today is hot and humid.\nIntent1: Rain\nIntent2: Sunny", "output": "Intent1: 0.5\nIntent2: 0.5"}, {"instruction": "Given a sentence, output the word count.", "input": "I wanted to go to the beach.", "output": "Word Count: 5"}, {"instruction": "What is the average temperature in winter in Antarctica?", "input": "", "output": "The average temperature in winter in Antarctica is around -60 °C (-76 °F)."}, {"instruction": "Describe the painting 'Basket of Apples\" by Paul Cezanne", "input": "", "output": "Paul Cezanne's 'Basket of Apples' painting is a still life composed of a simple table top setting with a large wicker basket of apples balanced on top.
