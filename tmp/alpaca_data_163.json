Nuclear energy carries the risk of nuclear accidents, which have already caused catastrophic damage in Russia and Japan, and can have lasting consequences for generations. Nuclear energy is also extremely expensive, requiring billions in capital to be allocated for its production and maintenance. Finally, nuclear waste can remain dangerous for thousands of years, requiring extensive mitigation efforts to ensure that radiation doesn’t accidentally contaminate our biosphere. In short, there are far more efficient and safe ways of producing the energy that we need, making nuclear energy unnecessary and dangerous."}, {"instruction": "List the advantages of electric cars over traditional gasoline cars.", "input": "", "output": "The advantages of electric cars over traditional gasoline cars include: \n1. Lower emissions and greater energy efficiency – electric cars produce substantially fewer harmful emissions than gasoline cars, and they are more energy-efficient. \n2. Lower maintenance costs – electric cars require less frequent servicing and usually have few moving parts, resulting in lower overall maintenance costs. \n3. Lower fuel costs – electric cars require far less fuel than gasoline cars, resulting in cost savings over time. \n4. Longer ranges – electric cars can travel much further on a single charge than gasoline cars, making them ideal for long commutes. \n5. Quieter operation – electric cars are far quieter than gasoline cars, making them more pleasant to drive."}, {"instruction": "Replace every instance of the word 'accordingly' with a synonym in the following sentence:", "input": "The police closed the streets accordingly.", "output": "The police closed the streets thereby."}, {"instruction": "Outline the steps necessary to enroll in college.", "input": "", "output": "The steps necessary to enroll in college include: \n1.

With the advent of the internet and mobile devices, workers are increasingly able to work remotely and have greater access to their jobs and colleagues outside of traditional office hours. This has the potential to greatly increase the amount of time and energy that individuals are able to dedicate to their job, making it more difficult to properly unplug and relax. Moreover, the instant availability of information and resources can make it difficult to completely escape from work obligations. While technological advancements can have many positive benefits, it is important to be mindful of the impact it can have on work/life balance."}, {"instruction": "Explain the role of enzymes in catalysis.", "input": "", "output": "Enzymes are molecules that catalyze biochemical reactions in living cells. They work by lowering the energy barrier of a reaction, which allows the reaction to occur more quickly. Enzymes are highly specific and typically only catalyze one type of reaction. Moreover, they are able to bind with the substrates of the reaction, allowing the substrates to remain in close proximity and enhancing the rate of the reaction. Enzymes are essential for sustaining life as they catalyze the multitude of biochemical reactions that occur continuously in our cells."}, {"instruction": "Identify the key differences between a butterfly and a moth.", "input": "", "output": "The key differences between butterflies and moths are primarily in their anatomy, behavior, and life cycles. Butterflies have larger wings that have brightly-colored patterns and typically fly during the day. In contrast, moths tend to be nocturnal and have dull colors and feathery patterns on their wings. Additionally, butterflies typically have slimmer bodies and antennae that have a clubbed end, while moths tend to have thicker bodies and feathery antennae. Finally, butterflies typically have complete metamorphosis in their life cycle, while moths tend to have a simpler life cycle with only two stages."}]
