[{"instruction": "Research and summarize a given historical event.", "input": "The Chicago Fire", "output": "The Chicago Fire was a disastrous blaze that burned for two days in the city of Chicago in October 1871. The fire originated in the O'Leary family's barn in the DeKoven Street neighborhood and quickly spread due to high winds and dry conditions. The fire destroyed an estimated 17,400 buildings and killed 300 people, while leaving 90,000 homeless. The cause remains a mystery, but popular belief holds that it began when a cow kicked over a lantern. The disaster had significant implications for the city, as it accelerated the decrease of the class divide and many famous buildings, such as the Chicago Water Tower, were constructed in the aftermath."}, {"instruction": "Generate a witty one-liner about robots.", "input": "", "output": "Robots have great potential — some even have the potential to be funny!"}, {"instruction": "List 3 instructions GPT models can do.", "input": "", "output": "GPT models can generate text, perform question-answering tasks, and participate in conversation dialogues."}, {"instruction": "Give a reason why GPT models are a powerful AI tool.", "input": "", "output": "GPT models are a powerful AI tool because they can be trained on a wide range of tasks, and they can generate human-like text outputs with high accuracy."}, {"instruction": "Retrieve and output the following quote from Shakespeare", "input": "\"To thine own self be true\"", "output": "\"This above all: to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man.\" - William Shakespeare, Hamlet"}, {"instruction": "Reformat this website's HTML code to make it more robust", "input": "<html>\n<head>\n<title>My Website</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<h1>My Website</h1>\n\n<p>Welcome to my website!</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>", "output": "<html>\n<head>\n    <title>My Website</title>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>My Website</h1>\n    <p>Welcome to my website!</p>\n</body>\n</html>"}, {"instruction": "Create a rap verse based off this prompt", "input": "\"Life moves fast and so must you\"", "output": "Life moves fast and nothing can slow it down, \nGotta keep grinding and push through the crowd. \nIt's a hustle and bustle, racing the clock, \nMakin' moves and never stoppin' to rock."}, {"instruction": "Give a few tips for applying for a job", "input": "", "output": "Research the company before applying, show enthusiasm in your cover letter and resume, tailor your application to fit the job requirements, emphasize your relevant skills and experiences, and make sure your application materials are error-free."}, {"instruction": "Reverse engineer a long phrase into a shorter one.", "input": "One should always strive for excellence in their career.", "output": "Strive for excellence."}, {"instruction": "Identify the type of each word in the sentence; form a table containing the word, its part of speech and its definition.", "input": "The government has announced new lockdown measures.", "output": "| Word | Part of Speech | Definition |\n|-----|----------------|------------|\n| The | Article | A definite article used to refer to one particular noun |\n| government | Noun | A group of people who are responsible for governing a country or other political unit |\n| has | Verb | An auxiliary verb that is used to form the perfect and past perfect tenses of other verbs |\n| announced | Verb | Publish or proclaim publicly |\n| new | Adjective | Not existing before |\n| lockdown | Noun | A restriction on activities or movement to prevent the spread of disease |\n| measures | Noun | Actions taken to achieve a goal or to deal with a problem |"}, {"instruction": "Write a headline using available words.", "input": "open, opportunity, young", "output": "\"Open Up a World of Opportunity for Young People\""}, {"instruction": "Write a thoughtful quote of up to 10 words.", "input": "", "output": "\"Be the change you wish to see.\""}, {"instruction": "Derive a mathematical expression from the sentence.", "input": "The total number of visitors to the zoo is three times the number of animals in the safari.", "output": "V = 3A, where V is the total number of visitors and A is the number of animals in the safari."}, {"instruction": "Describe a situation that demonstrates a strong sense of leadership.", "input": "", "output": "When I was a member of a student council, I hosted a successful teambuilding event for the members.
