Crackles of thunder and streaks of lightning lit up the sky. Everyone was inside hiding from the storm, except for one brave young student, who ventured outside to experience the harsh conditions. As they walked, they noticed that their glasses, which had become an integral part of their identity, were nowhere to be found. After a frantic search, they realized that their glasses must have dropped off somewhere in the dark rain. With no choice, the student began a journey, one that may lead them far, in hopes of finding their lost glasses. \n\nThe student trekked through dense forests, climbing up hills and braving treacherous rivers in search of something that now seemed so distant. Several days passed and their hope was starting to fade. But then, one fateful afternoon, their eyes caught a glimmer in the corner of their vision. They rushed towards the source, and to their surprise, it was their glasses. The student was overjoyed to find them, and they knew they would never be as careless with their glasses ever again. \n\nThe student thanked the storm for uniting them with their lost glasses, and continued on their journey, back home."}, {"instruction": "Detect the subject and the predicate in the following sentence.", "input": "Many of us are studying hard.", "output": "Subject: Many of us\nPredicate: are studying hard."}, {"instruction": "What is a positive adjective for describing a relationship?", "input": "", "output": "A positive adjective for describing a relationship is harmonious."}, {"instruction": "Calculate the perimeter of a rectangle with dimensions 6m by 12m.", "input": "", "output": "The perimeter of the rectangle is 36m."}, {"instruction": "Name an ocean current in the South Atlantic", "input": "", "output": "The South Atlantic has the Brazilian Current as one of its main ocean currents."}, {"instruction": "Give an example of an idea that would make life easier.", "input": "", "output": "Developing a system to automatically recognize voices and carry out tasks based on verbal commands would make life easier."}, {"instruction": "What items should be included in a basic emergency first aid kit?", "input": "", "output": "A basic emergency first aid kit should include items such as adhesive bandages, sterile gauze pads, antiseptic wipes, medical tape, scissors, tweezers, adhesive wound closure strips, safety pins, disposable gloves, space blankets, instant cold packs, blanket rolls, splints, pain relievers, and a first-aid manual."}, {"instruction": "Generate two humourous responses to the given joke.", "input": "Q: What did the invisible man say to his girlfriend?\nA: Nothing, he just gave her a wink.", "output": "1.

As the molecules collide and gain kinetic energy, they spread apart and the liquid begins to evaporate. This increase in kinetic energy causes the molecules to break free from the surface of the liquid and float in the air as water vapor. \n\nThe molecules continue to absorb energy from the sun and become less dense until they are light enough to travel through the air. As the molecules travel further and further away, they eventually cool and condense into droplets.
