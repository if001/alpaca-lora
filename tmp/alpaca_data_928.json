It has the potential to solve problems that classical computers are unable to, such as simulating quantum systems and searching large databases. A quantum computer uses quantum bits, or qubits, to store information instead of the traditional binary bits of classical computers. Qubits have the ability to be in multiple states between 0 and 1, allowing for much greater throughput of information. By utilizing quantum algorithms and principles, quantum computers have the potential to solve complex problems in a fraction of the time that a classical computer would take."}]
