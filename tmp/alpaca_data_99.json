He would often bark out conversations, much to the surprise of people who passed by. \n\nOne day, Pongo was out for a walk and he happened to pass by a park. There, he noticed a little girl who was crying. Concerned, Pongo walked towards her and asked her what was wrong. The little girl didn't seem to understand him, but eventually she managed to blurt out that she had lost her doll. \n\nPongo, not one to give up easily, began to search around the park for the doll, sniffing around trees and peeking behind benches. Finally, he sniffed it out - the little girl's doll was stuck in a bush!\n\nPongo ran over, grabbed the doll, and presented it to the girl. She was filled with joy and wrapped her arms around Pongo, thanking him for finding her lost doll. From then on, Pongo and the little girl became best of friends and would go for walks around the park together every day."}, {"instruction": "Find the next 3 terms in the following sequence: 4, 6, 9, 12", "input": "", "output": "15, 18, 21"}, {"instruction": "Provide two of the most common uses for a hammer.", "input": "", "output": "The two most common uses for a hammer are to drive nails into wood or other materials, and to remove nails."}, {"instruction": "Generate a travel route from London to Moscow.", "input": "", "output": "The most direct route from London to Moscow is to fly to Amsterdam and then take a connecting flight to Moscow.
