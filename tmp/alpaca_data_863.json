This is the Pythagorean Theorem. If we assume the converse, namely that A² + B² = C² implies C is the longest side, then there is a possibility of a triangle where A > C or B > C. This contradicts the original assumption that C is the longest side of the triangle, therefore proving that the converse of the Pythagorean Theorem is false."}, {"instruction": "Produce a conversation between two people using the context \"Meeting at Starbucks\"", "input": "", "output": "Jane: Hi, how are you?\n\nJohn: Hi!

This event is considered to be the first act of open defiance by the American colonists against British rule. The colonists were angered by the fact that the British had imposed a tax on tea, even though they were not represented in the British Parliament.
