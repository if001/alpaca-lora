It is an orbiting habitat that houses astronauts and researchers, while they conduct experiments and observations of Earth. The station is almost completely modular and is constantly reconfigured to suit the needs of those onboard. On the inside, the station is partitioned into numerous modules devoted to research and living accommodations. These modules come and go as the station is serviced by multiple cargo vehicles and space shuttles. The station is also equipped with numerous robotic and experimental arms as well as a robotic refueling system. These arms and robotics allow the station to carry out various experiments, maintenance tasks, and repairs. Additionally, the station is home to a variety of scientific instruments, such as a mass spectrometer and other specialised equipment. The station is also a significant source of information as it collects data on Earth's environment, as well as data and images of extrasolar planets. The space station also serves as a platform for regular spacewalks by astronauts and works as a testing ground for advanced technology, like communications and ultra-efficient solar panels. In essence, the space station is an incredible example of humanity's capabilities, and serves as a stepping-stone to explore and better understand our universe."}, {"instruction": "Given the following statement, classify if it is a fact or opinion.

The main advantages of the decision tree algorithm is that it can be easily and quickly understood, requires relatively little data preparation and is able to handle both continuous and categorical data. However, decision trees are prone to overfitting, where the model is overly complex and fits the training data too closely. This can lead to poor generalization performance on unseen datasets. Additionally, decision trees can be unstable, with small changes in the training data leading to large changes in the structure of the decision tree. Finally, decision trees often require to be pruned to reduce the overfitting, which can be computationally expensive."}, {"instruction": "Generate a creative writing prompt.", "input": "", "output": "A group of teens stumble upon an abandoned laboratory in the middle of the woods.

The learning rate is used to determine how quickly the network should adjust its weights in response to incoming data. If the learning rate is too low, the network may fail to converge and the optimization process can take much longer. On the other hand, if the learning rate is too high the network may miss an optimal solution, as it adjusts its weights too aggressively. Choosing an appropriate learning rate is critical to train the network efficiently and achieve an optimal result."}]
