Start by making a list of all the tasks you need to do, then prioritize them into three categories: Important/Urgent, Important/Not Urgent, and Not Important/Not Urgent. Focus on the tasks that are Important/Urgent first, followed by the Important/Not Urgent tasks, then the Not Important/Not Urgent tasks. Additionally, break big tasks down into smaller ones, to make them easier to manage and complete. Finally, set reasonable deadlines for yourself and use reminders or a calendar to ensure that tasks get completed on time."}, {"instruction": "Describe how a GPT model works.", "input": "", "output": "A GPT (generative pre-trained transformer) model is a type of natural language processing (NLP) model that has been pre-trained on a large corpus of text. The model uses a transformer architecture that helps it capture the context of the words in a sentence. This allows the model to generate natural-sounding sentences based on an input prompt. The GPT model is able to predict the next word in a sentence given previously seen words in the sentence, and can be further fine-tuned to generate more diverse and personalized outputs."}, {"instruction": "Generate an article about the current political situation in India.", "input": "", "output": "The current political situation in India is volatile and uncertain due to the upcoming general elections. With the Bharatiya Janata Partyâ€“led government in power since 2014, India has seen many major changes in public policies and laws, including the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, changes in labor laws, and stray incidents of violence. The issues of economic recession and unemployment have not been adequately addressed, while agrarian distress and lack of adequate social welfare have been constantly challenged. The political climate has become increasingly polarized as parties have engaged in provocative campaigns to attract voters. With the elections just weeks away, the political landscape in India is rife with uncertainty.
