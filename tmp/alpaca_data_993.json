The Tibetan wolf is an apex predator in its natural environment, and preys primarily on various species of deer, wild boar, and other large hoofed mammals. It is also an opportunistic hunter, and will also eat smaller prey like hares, rodents, birds, and reptiles. Despite its large population, the Tibetan wolf is threatened by a variety of factors, including habitat loss, and is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List.
