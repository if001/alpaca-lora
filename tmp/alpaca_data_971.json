This allows for a secure and tamper-proof way of verifying and recording transactions.\n\nThe data in the blockchain is stored in blocks, where each block is linked to the previous block. This block chain is resistant to alterations and can only be updated with the consensus of the network. These blocks are linked with a cryptographic hash, so that any changes made to the data will be immediately detected.\n\nBlockchain technology has a wide range of applications beyond digital currency, such as identity management, smart contracts, data storage, and verification of digital assets."}]
