It can generate text quickly and accurately by using large datasets, which can be used for natural language processing tasks such as summarization, question-answering, and text generation. GPT models are also scaleable, meaning they are able to process complex tasks with minimal resources. They are fast and require no human effort to train, which makes them useful for quickly generating results in various tasks where manual work may be too expensive or slow. Additionally, GPT models are highly flexible, allowing developers to easily adjust the output according to their own preferences. In short, GPT models are an efficient and cost-effective way to generate text."}, {"instruction": "Compare two types of text processing techniques and explain differences between them.", "input": "Rule-Based Text Processing and Deep Learning Based Text Processing", "output": "Rule-based text processing is based on hand-crafted rules for understanding the text. It relies on human experts to define the rules, which can require significant time and effort. It is able to accurately parse and manipulate text, but it is limited in its accuracy and speed. Deep learning based text processing uses algorithms to learn from datasets and extract patterns from text. It is able to process text with high accuracy and at a much faster rate than rule-based text processing. Deep learning models are also more flexible and can be adapted to different tasks with little effort. Deep learning is thus better suited for more complex text processing tasks."}, {"instruction": "Summarize the article below in 5 sentences.", "input": "The COVID-19 crisis has brought many changes to our everyday lives, including the way we work and interact.
