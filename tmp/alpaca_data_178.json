We would need to cut the balsa wood into four pieces - two of them measuring fifteen cm in length, and the other two measuring twelve cm in length. The two twelve cm pieces will be used for the sides of the catapult, while the fifteen cm pieces will be used for the cross pieces. We will use one of the dowels to make the throwing arm, while the other can be used as an axle. We will tie the three rubber bands together and secure them to the sides of the catapult, allowing us to attach the throwing arm to the rubber bands for added power. Finally, we will wrap the fabric around the axle for a better grip, and glue all the pieces together to complete the mini catapult."}, {"instruction": "What is the main ingredient of french toast?", "input": "", "output": "The main ingredient of french toast is typically eggs."}, {"instruction": "Compare the features of a car and a bike.", "input": "", "output": "A car typically has higher acceleration and speed than a bike, while a bike is typically lighter, more maneuverable, and cheaper than a car.
