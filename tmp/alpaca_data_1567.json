Inside the cell, neurotransmitters are released from the end of one neuron to the beginning of another.

When enough neurotransmitters accumulate on the receptors, it triggers a nerve impulse, resulting in the postsynaptic neuron to fire. This sends an electrical signal down the neuron, which relays information to other neurons in the network."}]
