[{"instruction": "Generate a story about a bear and a rabbit that live in a forest.", "input": "", "output": "Once upon a time in a magical forest, there lived a bear and a rabbit. The bear was a large and powerful creature, while the rabbit was small and timid.\n\nOne day, the bear was walking in the forest when he stumbled upon the rabbit nibbling on some grass. The bear was feeling kind and wanted to make a new friend, so he offered to take the rabbit on a grand adventure. \n\nThe rabbit was unsure at first, but eventually he agreed. So, they set off together, exploring the wonders of the forest. They played in the fields, climbed trees, and enjoyed the beauty of nature.\n\nOver time, the bear and the rabbit became the best of friends. No matter what happened, they could always rely on each other. \n\nEven when the darkness of the night came and the days were filled with danger, their friendship always lasted. It became a symbol of hope and courage for all the animals in the forest. And so, the bear and the rabbit lived happily ever after."}, {"instruction": "Make a list of safety precautions that people should follow if they find a wild animal in their home.", "input": "", "output": "- Remain calm and do not panic.\n- Do not try to handle the animal yourself, as this could be dangerous.\n- If the animal is inside your house, try to close off the area to minimize itâ€™s movement.\n- Try to block off any areas the animal could escape to, such as windows or doors.\n- If possible, call a professional wildlife service for assistance in safely removing the animal.\n- Keep children and pets away from the area.\n- Do not make loud noises or sudden movements.\n- Do not attempt to touch or move the animal."}, {"instruction": "Explain the concepts of shallow learning and deep learning.", "input": "", "output": "Shallow learning is a type of machine learning which uses easier to train algorithms to learn simpler patterns in data. It requires less data and computing power compared to deep learning, and focuses on learning pre-defined or known patterns in data. Such algorithms are used to address problems that do not need to adapt quickly to data. \n\nDeep learning, on the other hand, is a type of machine learning that uses multiple layers of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to learn more complex patterns in data. It typically performs better than shallow learning algorithms, as it can learn from more data and learn more generalizable patterns. Deep learning also can infer useful information from unlabeled data, and can handle complex tasks like image and speech recognition."}, {"instruction": "Sum up the main idea from the passage.", "input": "In late 2020, Bitcoin continues to be the most popular crypto currency.
