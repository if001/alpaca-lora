The disruption of wildlife habitats has led to greater contact between members of the animal kingdom, resulting in more pathogens and diseases being passed between species. In addition, large-scale changes in land use and farming have resulted in humans coming in contact with new pathogens, vastly increasing the potential for epidemic and pandemic spread. Furthermore, rising global temperatures have resulted in more heat waves, allowing pathogenic organisms to survive in otherwise uninhabitable areas. All of these factors contribute to the current pandemic, and climate change is the underlying cause of them all."}, {"instruction": "Write a letter to a friend about your recent experiences.", "input": "", "output": "Dear Friend, \n\nI hope this letter finds you well.

Improved loading times – A CDN stores copies of content on multiple servers located around the world. This ensures that content is delivered to users quickly, since they’ll be accessing the content from a server close to them. \n2. Lower bandwidth and costs – CDNs use caching to reduce the amount of data that needs to be sent over the internet. This reduces bandwidth usage, which in turn leads to lower costs for the user.\n3. Improved reliability and uptime – Since the same content is stored on multiple CDN servers, the risk of downtime is greatly reduced. This also makes CDN networks more reliable and less likely to suffer from server overloads."}, {"instruction": "Make up a story about a robot who has quit its job.", "input": "", "output": "Once upon a time, there was a robot named Roger.
