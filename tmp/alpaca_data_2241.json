They use programming languages such as Ruby, Python and Java to write the code, and they possess a broad understanding of the software development process, including design, software testing, debugging, and computer networks. Computer programmers also need to be able to collaborate and communicate effectively with their colleagues in order to ensure that the application they are working on meets their team's standards.\n\nComputer programmers need to be highly organized, creative problem solvers. They must be adept at both core programming techniques and software development. Problem-solving skills are particularly important when making sure that code is optimized, in line with the specifications of the application, free from programming errors, and secure.\n\nIn order to stay up-to-date with best practices and emerging technologies, computer programmers must be willing to engage in continuing education, such as attending conferences and seminars, or taking online courses. They continuously strive to make their code the most efficient it can be, and need to be able to think outside the box in order to come up with innovative solutions."}, {"instruction": "Rewrite the following sentence with better grammar and without using the word \"very\".\n\nMy favorite food is very yummy.", "input": "My favorite food is very yummy.", "output": "My favorite food is delicious."}, {"instruction": "Given the following array, print out maximum value in descending order. \n\n[4, 8, 0, 9, 15]", "input": "[4, 8, 0, 9, 15]", "output": "15\n9\n8\n4\n0"}, {"instruction": "Find the most efficient way to sort the following array using a single line of code. \n\n[6, 8, 12, 4, 7]", "input": "[6, 8, 12, 4, 7]", "output": "[4, 6, 7, 8, 12]"}, {"instruction": "Edit the following sentence so that it is more concise and grammatically correct.\n\nI am a teacher and I likes to teach", "input": "I am a teacher and I likes to teach", "output": "I am a teacher and I like to teach."}, {"instruction": "Find the average of the following numbers without using calculator\n\n17, 23, 19", "input": "17, 23, 19", "output": "19.67"}, {"instruction": "Write an introduction to an essay about climate change.", "input": "", "output": "Climate change is an issue that has been discussed for centuries and is becoming an increasingly urgent reality of the world we live in today.
