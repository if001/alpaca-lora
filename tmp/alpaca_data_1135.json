Technology can lead to overstimulation, distraction, and disconnection with the physical world, leading to mental health issues like anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Additionally, excessive technology use can make it difficult to socialize in person, leading to decreased communication and physical interaction with peers. Another concern is the potential threat of technology replacing or displacing jobs. Many traditional, labor-intensive occupations are being replaced by automated machines and software, resulting in global unemployment. Finally, while the advancement of technology is often lauded as a way to combat climate change, if not regulated, unchecked technology growth can have significant environmental implications, such as increased pollution and energy consumption."}, {"instruction": "Given a string of words, break it into a list of words.", "input": "Technology is shaping our future", "output": "[\"Technology\", \"is\", \"shaping\", \"our\", \"future\"]"}, {"instruction": "Research one of the most common ethical issues related to data collection.", "input": "", "output": "One of the most common ethical issues related to data collection is the risk of data being used without people's knowledge or consent.

Data collected without permission can be used to make automated decisions, such as credit scoring or job applications, or manipulated to serve a certain agenda. Additionally, people's data can be leaked or sold without their knowledge, leading to potential security risks or financial harm. There is also the potential for discrimination or bias in data collection if companies obtain or use data in ways that are not fair or equitable.

Floods usually occur during monsoon season, caused by excessive rainfall and poor infrastructure. Cyclones are intense low-pressure cyclonic storms that cause heavy rains and strong wind gusts, often leading to flooding and death. Droughts are periods of unusually low precipitation that can lead to water shortages, crop failure, and famine. Landslides occur when high levels of precipitation cause the soil and rocks to become unstable and slide downhill, resulting in property damage. Avalanches occur when a large mass of snow is destabilized and slides down a mountain. Extreme temperatures can be experienced in the summers due to heat waves and in the winters due to cold waves, causing deadly heat- and cold- related illnesses. Earthquakes can occur due to tectonic plate shifts, resulting in injures and deaths as well as destruction of property and infrastructure. Finally, air pollution caused by factors such as burning of fossil fuels, automobiles, and industrial plants can lead to respiratory diseases and poor public health."}, {"instruction": "Given a list of prices and a budget, tell me what items I can afford.", "input": "[10, 20, 30, 40], budget = 50", "output": "You can afford items with prices of 10, 20, 30, 40."}, {"instruction": "Grade the following essay, using a scale of 0-5.", "input": "The rising cost of higher education has made college increasingly out of reach for many students.
