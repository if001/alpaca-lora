It is based on the teachings of the Vedas and originally consisted of restrictions on food and substances, different forms of breathing exercises, and postures. The main intent of yoga was to still the mind, focus on the breath, and reach a deeper level of connection with the spiritual world."}, {"instruction": "Compare and contrast two theories of evolution.", "input": "", "output": "The two main theories of evolution are Lamarckism and Darwinism. Lamarckism, proposed by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in 1809, states that organisms can pass acquired traits to their offspring. This is the idea of “use and disuse”, where organisms modify their behavior and organs to better fit their environment, and these changes then get inherited. On the other hand, Darwinism, proposed by Charles Darwin in 1859, relies on the concept of natural selection. This theory states that organisms inherit heritable traits from their parents, and those organisms with traits best suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce. This leads to a gradual accumulation of beneficial traits in successive generations.\n \nBoth theories share the idea of heritability. However, the main difference lies in how traits get inherited. Lamarckism suggests that traits are actively acquired during an organism's lifetime and then passed down to offspring, while Darwinism suggests that traits are inherited from parents and random mutations can lead to variation in traits."}, {"instruction": "Explain what the function 'count_words' does in Python.", "input": "", "output": "The function 'count_words' is a Python function that takes a string as an argument, and returns the number of words contained in the string.

Policy-based access control uses predetermined rules to grant permissions for a user's activity. Role-based access control manages user permissions based on the user's assigned role. Attribute-based access control allows administrators to define certain attributes and grant or deny access according to those attributes. Identity-based access control assigns permissions to a user based on their unique identity.

Feudalism was based on a hereditary noble class that held all the land and power, while capitalism was based on free trade and the free market. In feudalism, success was determined by the family’s class; in capitalism, success is determined by individual effort. Feudalism allowed for limited class mobility while capitalism allowed for open class mobility. Capitalism is more efficient in terms of resource allocation, as decisions are made based on market supply and demand as opposed to a centralized command structure in feudalism. Lastly, feudalism rewarded loyalty to the ruling class, while capitalism rewards loyalty to the free market."}, {"instruction": "Perform a sentiment analysis for the following text.", "input": "Learning Machine Learning has given me such powerful tools", "output": "The sentiment of the text is positive because it is expressing how learning Machine Learning has given the speaker powerful tools."}, {"instruction": "Write a Python function to sort a two-dimensional array based on a given column index", "input": "Array = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]]\nColumn index = 2", "output": "def sortByColIndex(arr, col_index): \n  \n    arr.sort(key=lambda x : x[col_index]) \n    return arr \n\nsortedArray = sortByColIndex(arr, 2) \nprint(sortedArray) \n\nOutput:\n[[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4], [9, 8, 7]]"}, {"instruction": "Explain the advantages and disadvantages of using a decision tree", "input": "", "output": "Advantages of using a decision tree are that it is simple to understand and explain, allows for the incorporation of new data, and is resistant to outliers.
