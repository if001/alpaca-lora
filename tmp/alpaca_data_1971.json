In pre-training, the GPT model is trained with large unsupervised datasets on language modeling tasks. This helps the GPT model learn general word-level associations and build a good foundation for understanding language. During the fine-tuning phase, GPT models are adapted to specific domains by providing supervised datasets. This allows the GPT model to learn task-specific representations which further enhance the performance."}]
