Not only are farmers affected by extreme weather, but their land and livestock suffer too. As temperatures continue to rise, their once-fertile pastures and land become dry and barren, and their animals suffer from the heat and lack of food. In order to keep up with the changing demand for food, family farms must adapt to these new climates, or face extinction."}, {"instruction": "Identify the word in the sentence that has a positive connotation.", "input": "She was an excelling student.", "output": "Excelling"}, {"instruction": "Explain how \"types\" is used in programming languages.", "input": "No input required.", "output": "In programming, a type is a classification of data that dictates how different elements can be interacted with and used.

It has a variety of direct benefits, ranging from cost savings to improved access to jobs and educational opportunities. For one thing, public transportation supports sustainability goals. It reduces the number of cars on the road, resulting in decreased air pollution, fewer greenhouse gas emissions, and improved public health. Additionally, public transportation is cheaper than driving a car when factoring in expenses such as gas, insurance, and parking. This makes it the ideal choice for people with limited or fixed incomes, or those who can’t afford other travel options. Furthermore, public transportation helps to decrease overall traffic congestion, since fewer cars on the road mean less competition for space. This also cuts down on response times for emergency services, making them more efficient and reliable. Lastly, public transportation is a great way to give people access to jobs and educational opportunities that may otherwise be inaccessible due to lack of resources or transportation expenses. In conclusion, public transportation comes with many benefits and should be supported as a key transportation resource."}, {"instruction": "Outline the advantages and disadvantages of using cryptocurrencies.", "input": "No input required.", "output": "Advantages of using cryptocurrencies include increased privacy and security, lower fees and faster transaction times, reduced risks for merchants and buyers, and greater ability to bypass traditional financial systems.
