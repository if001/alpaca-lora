Numerous studies have shown that multitasking leads to decreased focus and cognitive resources, which affects the quality of work. It has also been suggested that multitasking disrupts short-term and long-term memory, negatively impacts decision-making abilities, and ultimately leads to lower productivity. \n\nFor example, a study by the University of London found that when participants were asked to switch tasks multiple times, their IQ dropped by more than ten points on average. Additionally, research from Harvard University suggests that multitasking can cause a decrease in efficiency of up to 40%.\n\nTherefore, it seems that multitasking has a negative impact on one's productivity. Ultimately, it is best to focus on one task at a time in order to get the best results."}, {"instruction": "Provide specific examples of the nitrogen cycle.", "input": "", "output": "The nitrogen cycle is the process of nitrogen being exchanged between living organisms and their environment. \n\nOne example is nitrification. This is the process of bacteria converting ammonia and nitrites into nitrates, which are usable by plants. This process occurs in both soil, aquatic environments, and the atmosphere. The nitrate is then taken up by the plants, which can then be consumed by animals.\n\nAnother example is denitrification which occurs in soil environments. This is the process of bacteria converting nitrates into nitrogen gas which is released back into the atmosphere. \n\nLastly, nitrogen fixation is a process that occurs in aquatic and soil environments. This is the process of lightning and bacteria converting nitrogen gas into an inert form, such as ammonia, which can then be converted into nitrates by the same bacteria for use by plants. \n\nThese 3 types of processes make up the nitrogen cycle which is vital in sustaining life on earth."}, {"instruction": "Edit the given sentence to make sure it conforms to academic writing standards.", "input": "I believe that internet addiction needs to be taken seriously, its very real", "output": "I believe that Internet addiction needs to be taken seriously; it is very real."}, {"instruction": "Estimate the amount of money spent by the customer on a flight ticket.", "input": "The customer bought a one-way ticket from Zurich to London with a fare of 150 euros.", "output": "The customer spent 150 euros on a one-way flight ticket from Zurich to London."}, {"instruction": "Compose a tweet given the author and content.", "input": "Author: John\nContent: The world needs more kindness", "output": "John (@John): Sending lots of love and kindness out into the world today.
