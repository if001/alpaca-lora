The method assumes that the particles behavior is driven by simple equations of motion, making it different from the classical ray tracing method which did not consider the motion of the particles. KRT starts by calculating the physical parameters at each particle position and then releasing a set of rays from the view point of the observer that are propagated through the particles trajectories. As the rays move between the particles positions, their parameters are updated accordingly, and at the end of the calculations, the collected information is rendered according to the observers viewpoint."}, {"instruction": "A debate team needs to decide on a stance for their debate.

The use of technology is increasingly becoming a central part of our lives and is improving just about every aspect of our lives. Not only is it beneficial for communication, leisure, convenience, and productivity, but technology is now an important factor in improving education, health, security and overall quality of life. \n\nFrom being able to access the internet from virtually anywhere to the rise of smart phones that allow us to stay connected to the people, services and information we need, technology is becoming a part of our lives that we cannot do away with. We can now find and access information from anywhere in the world with high speed internet access and search engines. Smartphones allow us to easily stay connected to the people we care about, from messaging apps to VoIP, video calls and more. Staying productive and organized is easier than ever with cloud storage, task management and communication apps. \n\nThe use of technology also has its advantages when it comes to healthcare and education. With the advancement of medical technology, treatments, diagnoses and recovery have been able to improve greatly over time. Technology can be used to improve health care by helping doctors to quickly access patient records, and develop personalized treatments. Likewise in the educational field, technology can enhance learning and empower students with the ability to easily access educational materials online and research tools to their studies.\n\nWhether it be in communication, leisure, or productivity, the use of technology has become an integral part of our lives. With the advances in technology and the potential it holds, we are only seeing the beginning of its potential to improve our quality of life."}, {"instruction": "Change the following sentence in the second person and make sure it is in the present tense.", "input": "I love singing in the rain.", "output": "You love singing in the rain."}, {"instruction": "Given a set of instructions, rewrite them in a formal language.", "input": "Request your users to input the details.", "output": "Users are requested to provide the necessary details."}, {"instruction": "Given the following sentence, create a list of idiomatic expressions that could be used to rephrase the sentence.", "input": "We are standing still.", "output": "at a standstill; caught in limbo; not making progress; stagnation; staying put; at a halt; stuck in the mud; at a crossroads; no movement; on pause; immobile; unmoving."}, {"instruction": "Construct a sentence that uses the given words in the given order.", "input": "words: politics, control, economy\norder: control, economy, politics", "output": "Politics control the economy."}, {"instruction": "Create a Sudoku board from a given array.", "input": "1 4 5 0 0 0 0 3 9\n0 0 0 8 0 3 4 0 0\n0 0 9 0 0 0 6 8 0\n0 0 3 7 0 0 0 0 4\n0 9 0 0 6 0 0 7 0\n6 0 0 0 0 4 9 0 0\n0 3 1 0 0 0 5 0 0\n0 0 7 2 0 5 0 0 0\n5 2 0 0 0 0 7 4 8", "output": "1 4 5 | 6 2 7 | 8 3 9 \n7 8 2 | 8 1 3 | 4 5 6 \n3 6 9 | 4 5 8 | 6 8 2 \n-- -- --+-- -- --+-- -- --\n2 5 3 | 7 9 6 | 1 8 4 \n4 9 8 | 3 6 1 | 2 7 5 \n6 7 1 | 5 8 4 | 9 2 3 \n-- -- --+-- -- --+-- -- --\n8 3 1 | 9 7 2 | 5 6 4 \n9 1 7 | 2 4 5 | 3 6 8 \n5 2 4 | 1 3 6 | 7 4 8"}, {"instruction": "Describe the metamorphosis of a caterpillar into a butterfly.", "input": "", "output": "Metamorphosis is the process by which a caterpillar transforms itself into a butterfly.
