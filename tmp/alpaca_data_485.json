Furthermore, climate change has led to rising temperatures, higher sea levels, increased water salinity, and a decrease in availability of fresh water as precipitation patterns change. As a result, agricultural production is expected to decline particularly in areas where temperatures are already close to the optimal range for crop growth. Extreme weather conditions will lead to disruptions in production and transportation of food supplies, leading to a decline in food security. The repercussions of these effects will be most severely felt in the developing world, where agricultural activities are an integral part of the economy."}, {"instruction": "Design a poster for a student film festival.", "input": "", "output": "In vibrant hues of blue, green and yellow, the poster features a simple poster design.
