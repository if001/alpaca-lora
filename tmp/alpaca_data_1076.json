Every day, they would take the bird out of its tiny cage and set it on a plate on the table. They would marvel as the bird basked in the sunlight and soaked in the attention of its human family. \n\nEvery morning, the family would rise and prepare a delectable assortment of fruits and seeds for their tiny treasure. They would fill the plate to the brim with their creation, and the bird would joyously peck away at its meal. As the day passed, the family would take pride in how much their pet had grown.\n\nThe bird was a blessing for the family; it became a symbol of hope and joy for them. However, as time slowly passed, nothing remains the same. \n\nA few years later, the tiny pet was growing old, and it was slowly becoming more frail. But it still held onto the same pride that it had had when it was young. On its last day, the family brought out the same small plate and filled it with its favorite food.\n\nThe bird quietly passed away that day, but the family was still proud of the time they had spent with their beloved pet. The words “plate” and “proud” became firmly entrenched in the families’ way of life, as they would always be reminded of their little friend every time they looked at the plate on their table."}, {"instruction": "Given two strings, A and B, write a program to determine whether the two strings are anagrams.", "input": "String A: \"rat\"\nString B: \"tar\"", "output": "def isAnagram(str1, str2): \n    # Getting length of both strings \n    n1 = len(str1) \n    n2 = len(str2) \n  \n    # Sorting both strings to make sure they have same letters \n    str1 = sorted(str1) \n    str2 = sorted(str2) \n  \n    # Comparing sorted strings \n    for i in range(0, n1): \n        if (str1[i] != str2[i]): \n            return False\n  \n    return True\n\n# Driver function \nStringA = \"rat\"\nStringB = \"tar\"\n\nif isAnagram(StringA, StringB): \n    print(\"Yes\")\nelse: \n    print(\"No\")"}, {"instruction": "Categorize the following words into two groups depending on their spelling.", "input": "bat, bird, bulb, brush", "output": "Group 1: bat, bulb, brush\nGroup 2: bird"}, {"instruction": "Given a budget of 50$, design a day trip for a family of 4 to a nearby destination.", "input": "", "output": "For our day trip, we would rent a car to get there since it's nearby.
