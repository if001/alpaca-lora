Young people, who make up a significant portion of the population, should have a say in their future and receive the same rights and benefits as adults. The young generation is very informed and conscious of the worldâ€™s current state, and is more likely to remain aware of their political environment as they age. Additionally, education plays a crucial role in the informed voting process, so it is important to note that the current voting age of 18 is set in many states just after high school graduation. Thus, young people are given the right to vote just when they become eligible to attend university, meaning they may not have received the necessary education.\n\nLowering the voting age also serves to engage younger people in civic participation, encouraging them to take an active role in politics, and ultimately leading to higher voter turnout for all age groups. Moreover, ultimately allowing youth to vote boosts civic engagement even beyond voting and encourages young people to express their thoughts and opinions.\n\nIn conclusion, the voting age should absolutely be lowered. Not only can it increase the number of politically-informed people, it can also simultaneously boost political enthusiasm overall. The youth should have the right and opportunity to participate in politics and be involved in oneâ€™s democracy and this could be realized by lowering the voting age."}, {"instruction": "What is the marketing funnel?", "input": "", "output": "The marketing funnel is a customer journey, starting with the moment a customer first interacts with a brand, then progressing through their journey until they become a paying customer.
