For example, low-income students are less likely to have access to enrichment opportunities such as tutoring, private music or language lessons, or extracurricular activities. They also tend to have fewer books at home, family members who are less able to help with homework, and parents who have less time and money to devote to their childrenâ€™s education. These disparities in resources can create an environment where low-income students fall behind their peers, leading to the achievement gap we see today. It is critical for us to provide additional resources to these students in order to close the gap and give all children an equal chance to succeed."}, {"instruction": "Make sure the sentence is parallel and consistent.", "input": "Drinking coffee and avoiding to hide feelings.", "output": "Drinking coffee and avoiding hiding feelings."}, {"instruction": "Track the highest peak of the stock prices in one day.", "input": "On October 27th, the stock price of Apple Inc. opened at $122.25 and closed at $113.00 with the highest daily peak of $126.00", "output": "Highest peak of the stock price on October 27th: $126.00"}, {"instruction": "Introduce the following topic with a sentence.", "input": "Volunteerism", "output": "Volunteerism is a rewarding way to engage in service and help the wider community."}, {"instruction": "Rewrite the sentence with the following word replaced by a synonym", "input": "The experiment yielded impressive results", "output": "The experiment yielded remarkable results."}, {"instruction": "Add two adjectives to this sentence that describe the quality of sleep", "input": "I had a good night's sleep", "output": "I had a restful and refreshing night's sleep."}, {"instruction": "Provide an input that can be used to complete the instruction", "input": "Compose a story about a person overcoming adversity.", "output": "Once upon a time, Josephine was a young girl living in rural India who was determined to become a doctor despite the many odds stacked against her.
