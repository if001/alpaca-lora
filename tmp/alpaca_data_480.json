This belief is especially important for those in the process of learning, as it provides individuals the motivation to try harder and recover from setbacks that may block their learning trajectories. Not only does it help them succeed in academics, but also gives them a leg up in other areas, such as careers and relationships."}, {"instruction": "Classify the following article as either a myth or fact.", "input": "The average lifespan of a hamster is three to four years.", "output": "Fact.

In the core of the sun, nuclear fusion reactions take place, converting hydrogen atoms into helium. This releases energy in the form of gamma radiation and other forms of radiant energy, which escape the sun’s core in the form of light and heat. This energy travels through space and eventually reaches the Earth’s atmosphere, where it is either absorbed, reflected or scattered before reaching the Earth’s surface. On the surface, this energy is converted into a number of forms (e.g. heat, light, kinetic energy), which are eventually converted back into energy and sent back out into space."}, {"instruction": "Generate a persuasive argument for banning plastic straws.", "input": "", "output": "Banning plastic straws is an essential step in preserving our planet's future. Single use plastic straws are a major contributor to plastic pollution, as it takes hundreds of years for them to degrade and they damage natural ecosystems.
