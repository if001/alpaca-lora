[{"instruction": "What is histogram equalization?", "input": "", "output": "Histogram equalization is a process that adjusts the contrast of a digital image by increasing the intensity of pixel maximums and minimums. This allows shadows and highlights of an image to be more evenly represented and provides a better balance of contrast between the images. The result is a sharper image with more uniform colors which is useful in many image processing applications."}, {"instruction": "Describe the differences between type I and type II errors.", "input": "", "output": "A type I error is a false positive, when a hypothesis test results in the rejection of a true null hypothesis.
