These emissions trap heat within the Earth, leading to an increase in global temperatures. \n\nThe effects of global warming are far-reaching and can be catastrophic. The rising temperatures are melting the polar ice caps, leading to a rise in sea levels and flooding of coastal regions. Rising temperatures are also leading to the spread of deserts, ocean acidification and disruption of the environment’s delicate balance. \n\nWhile global warming is a natural phenomenon, human activities have exacerbated the trend and made it more severe. Reducing emissions, promoting renewable energy and investing in innovative solutions are key to mitigating the effects of global warming.
