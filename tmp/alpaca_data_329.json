Avoiding sugary snacks and drinks, and eating foods with healthy fats and essential vitamins and minerals will help improve your mood, energy levels, and cognitive functioning. \n\nTake the time to connect with those around you. Connecting with others is important for staying emotionally healthy and can help provide a sense of purpose and connection. Schedule regular time with friends and family to hang out and share stories. \n\nTaking care of your mental health can be challenging, but it is an essential part of forming better habits.
