The motor usually connects to the existing transmission of the car, allowing the car to still be driven. The battery pack is typically comprised of several smaller energy storage cells, usually lithium-ion, and is usually located under the car's hood or somewhere in the rear of the car. Other components such as a DC-DC converter, motor controller and throttle may also be added."}, {"instruction": "Devise a feasible plan for a sustainable city.", "input": "", "output": "A sustainable city requires the integration of numerous potential solutions to conserve resources and reduce environmental impacts. These solutions include enforced green practices such as reduced waste, increased recycling and composting, efficient energy and water usage, and green transportation practices. \n\nIn terms of energy, solar panels and wind turbines could be used to generate electricity to power public spaces, as well as fuel electric busses and other green forms of transportation in the city. Alternatively, energy efficient buildings and appliances could be used to reduce energy usage, such as LED lighting, energy efficient appliances and double glazing windows, as well as insulation.\n\nFurthermore, the city should prioritize green waste management solutions, such as improved waste segregation, increased composting efforts and increased recycling. Finally, green infrastructure should be developed and integrated into the city, such as parks and green spaces, to reduce pollution, improve air quality and enhance biodiversity."}, {"instruction": "Create a program that finds the largest element in an array", "input": "[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]", "output": "\"\"\"\nWrite a program that finds the largest element in an array\n\"\"\"\n\ndef largest_element(arr):\n    max_element = arr[0]\n    \n    for element in arr:\n        if element > max_element:\n            max_element = element\n            \n    return max_element\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    arr = [2,4,6,8,10]\n    print('The largest element in the array is ', largest_element(arr))"}, {"instruction": "Summarize the academic article \"Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work\".", "input": "", "output": "The article \"Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work\" discusses the potential implications of artificial intelligence (AI) on the future of work.
