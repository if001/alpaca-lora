GPT models use large neural networks that consume large amounts of memory and computing power. Running them on a laptop computer, which typically has limited computing power and memory, will likely cause significantly slower training and inference times. Additionally, running complex tasks on a laptop will severely deplete the battery, and may even cause your laptop to overheat. It is better to run a GPT model on a larger machine or in the cloud, where there is sufficient computing power and memory available."}, {"instruction": "Classify the following sentence using the following emotion categories: fear, anger, joy, sadness.", "input": "I'm so proud of myself.", "output": "Joy."}, {"instruction": "Generate a sentence which uses the following phrase: \"at the end of the day\".", "input": "", "output": "At the end of the day, only time will tell how this situation will unfold."}, {"instruction": "Generate a descriptive sentence containing the following words: \"twilight\", \"enchanted\" and \"lake\".", "input": "", "output": "The lake glimmered beneath the enchanted twilight, sparkling like a blanket of stars."}, {"instruction": "Suggest a less common word to replace the word \"great\" in the following sentence:", "input": "He had a great day.", "output": "He had an excellent day."}, {"instruction": "Format this sentence according to Chicago Style for citations and bibliography: \"April 4, 1901 is the date of Teddy Roosevelt's first Presidential Inauguration\".", "input": "", "output": "Roosevelt, Theodore. “Teddy Roosevelt's First Presidential Inauguration.” April 4, 1901."}, {"instruction": "Identify the stressed syllable in the word \"convincible\".", "input": "", "output": "The stressed syllable in the word \"convincible\" is \"con-vi-\"."}, {"instruction": "Generate two ways to classify the following objects: paper, pencil, eraser, ruler.", "input": "", "output": "Classification 1:\nPaper, Pencil, Eraser, Ruler.\nClassification 2:\nWriting supplies: Pencil, Paper. \nCrafting supplies: Ruler, Eraser."}, {"instruction": "Generate a description of a cat walking in a courtyard.", "input": "", "output": "The cat gracefully strolled through the courtyard, its fur shimmering in the sunlight.

If the corner you want is already in the top layer, turn the top layer until the desired corner is in the forward-right-top position. Then twist the upper layer so that the corner fits into the right slot. \n3. Solve the middle layer: Look for two edge pieces needing to be swapped and position them so that they form a line when viewed from the top. Then twist the middle layer so that the two edge pieces are in the correct slot.\n4. Solve the bottom cross: Look for the cross pieces and line them up with the cross on the bottom layer. Then twist the bottom layer until the cross pieces match up the correct slots.\n5. Position the yellow corners : Hold the cube so that the bottom layer has the solved cross. Line up the yellow corner pieces with the yellow side of the cube. Then twist the bottom layer until the corner pieces snap into place. \n6.
