This process is designed to reduce emissions from entering the atmosphere. CSS is often seen as an effective way to reduce emissions in the short term and is usually more cost effective than other alternatives.\n\nRenewable energy sources produce energy from natural resources that can be continuously replenished. These sources generally produce no carbon emissions and are often seen as a long-term solution for reducing emissions. Renewable energy sources can be more expensive upfront but may result in lower prices once the source is set up. In addition, renewable energy can be used more flexibly and offer an alternative to traditional power sources."}, {"instruction": "Provide an example of a financial tool that is used to identify returns on an investment.", "input": "", "output": "A popular financial tool used to identify returns on an investment is the Internal Rate of Return (IRR).

It involves transforming raw datasets into ready-to-use form so that models can be trained with it. Common steps of data pre-processing include data cleaning, feature engineering, data normalization, and feature selection. Data cleaning involves identifying and addressing any errors, outliers, or missing values. Feature engineering is the process of transforming existing features to create new features that better capture the information contained in the raw data. Data normalization is used to rescale the values of certain features to a standard range which allows for more meaningful comparisons between features. In feature selection, irrelevant and redundant features are removed to reduce the complexity of the model and improve its accuracy."}]
