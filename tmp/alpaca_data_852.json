The earth's temperature is already warmer than it was before the Industrial Revolution due to the increasing amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels. This is resulting in more extreme weather events such as floods, droughts, hurricanes and severe storms. Additionally, it is causing sea levels to rise and ocean temperatures to increase, which is harming marine life. Climate change is also causing shifts in ecosystems and posing a threat to food production, economic growth and overall human health."}, {"instruction": "What would be the most important thing to consider when applying for a loan?", "input": "", "output": "The most important thing to consider when applying for a loan is whether or not you can afford to make the payments.

Eating healthy foods can help to improve physical health by providing vital nutrients to the body. Eating healthy can also help to boost mental health by improving mood, concentration, and cognitive function. Additionally, eating healthy can increase energy levels, helping you to stay active and perform better."}, {"instruction": "Compare and contrast cellular respiration and photosynthesis.", "input": "", "output": "Cellular respiration and photosynthesis are two processes that take place in the cells of living organisms, but they serve different functions. Cellular respiration is the process by which cells break down organic molecules, such as glucose, to produce energy. Photosynthesis is a process that uses light energy from the sun to convert carbon dioxide and water into organic molecules such as glucose, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. Although they have different functions, these processes are closely intertwined as the products of one are used as inputs for the other."}, {"instruction": "Categorize the type of these landmarks.", "input": "Grand Canyon, Statue of Liberty, Eiffel Tower", "output": "Grand Canyon: Natural Landmark\nStatue of Liberty: Monument\nEiffel Tower: Monument"}, {"instruction": "Suggest a snack for a 5 year-old for school.", "input": "", "output": "A cup of yogurt with slices of fresh fruit like banana or apple would be a great snack for a 5 year-old for school."}, {"instruction": "Provide advice on how to deal with a difficult situation in the workplace.", "input": "Your coworker is constantly undermining your efforts, and it is negatively impacting your work performance.", "output": "It can be difficult to deal with a situation where a co-worker is undermining your efforts.
