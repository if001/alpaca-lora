Tensions escalated further when the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary in 1914 by a Serbian nationalist led Austria-Hungary to declare war on Serbia. This declaration led to a chain reaction of declarations of war between the two military alliances, ultimately forming the conflict known as World War 1."}, {"instruction": "Provide an example of a metric system unit of time.", "input": "", "output": "An example of a metric system unit of time is the second."}, {"instruction": "What is the current status of the coronavirus pandemic?", "input": "", "output": "As of June 2021, the coronavirus pandemic is still a global health threat with over 160 million cases and 3.4 million deaths reported worldwide."}, {"instruction": "What countries were members of the Axis Powers in World War II?", "input": "", "output": "The countries that were members of the Axis Powers in World War II were Germany, Italy, Japan, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Finland."}, {"instruction": "Take the given phrase and create a pun.", "input": "Picture perfect", "output": "A picture perfect moment is like a \"framable frame\"."}, {"instruction": "Given a set of words, create a compound word from them.", "input": "blueberry, crunch", "output": "Blucrunch."}, {"instruction": "Replace the words with antonyms.", "input": "happy, nice", "output": "unhappy, unpleasant."}, {"instruction": "List three defining characteristics of the given item.", "input": "Hawks", "output": "Hawks are carnivorous birds of prey that have a sharp talon and a curved beak.
