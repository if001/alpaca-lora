It was fought primarily in Europe, between the Allied Powers and the Central Powers. Its causes can be traced back to the rivalry between the European colonial powers of France and Germany, and their respective allies. As a result of the war, the German Empire was abolished, and a new set of political arrangements was established in Europe. The aftermath of the war also spurred a massive transformation of global politics, economy, and culture, which continued into the mid-20th century. WWI was the first major war since the introduction of complex machinery and new technologies, such as tanks, machine guns, and chemical warfare. These technologies instigated unprecedented levels of carnage and destruction, leading to the deaths of an estimated 10 million people. WWI also marked the beginning of the modern era of terrorism and political violence, which still has significant implications for global politics today."}, {"instruction": "Generate a metaphor in the context of the given statement.", "input": "The world is a dangerous place", "output": "The world is a wild and unforgiving jungle, full of hidden threats and pitfalls."}, {"instruction": "Provide an explanation for global warming.", "input": "", "output": "Global warming is the long-term warming of the Earth’s climate due to human activities that increase certain gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide and methane.
