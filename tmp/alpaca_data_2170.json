[{"instruction": "Write a coding algorithm to generate a random number in a given range.", "input": "", "output": "The algorithm to generate a random number in a given range is as follows: \n1. Create a variable to store the minimum and maximum numbers of the range. \n2. Generate a random number between the min and max values of the range, using the built-in random() function.\n3. Use the modulo operator to ensure the random number is within the range.\n4. Use an if clause to check if the generated number is outside the required range.\n5. If the number is outside the range, repeat from step 2.\n6. Finally, return the generated random number."}, {"instruction": "Explain the purpose of the Iterative Development approach in software engineering.", "input": "", "output": "The Iterative Development approach is a cyclic software development process where each iteration builds upon the results of previous iterations. It emphasizes the importance of constant feedback and evaluation, where requirements, design, and the development process are all subject to regularly review and improvement. The goal of Iterative Development is to give users the ability to evaluate each iteration before proceeding to the next development stage, thus enabling them to make adjustments at any point within the development process as new information and insights are gained."}, {"instruction": "Create a product page for a ladder.", "input": "", "output": "The Ladder is perfect for everyday tasks around the house.
