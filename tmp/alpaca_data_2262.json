In other words, it is a process of teaching computers to find patterns or make decisions based on data, without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms typically learn from the data they are given and are able to adjust their output depending on the data they've seen. This allows machines to make more informed decisions and predictions. By using data, machine learning is able to produce more powerful and accurate results, making it extremely useful in many different fields."}, {"instruction": "Please provide a sample input for a classification task.", "input": "", "output": "For a classification task, a sample input could be a text document containing a news article about an event.
