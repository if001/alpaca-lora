First, it is a clean source of energy that does not produce any greenhouse gases or other pollutants. Solar energy also does not require a lot of maintenance and does not need to be constantly replenished like some other sources, such as natural gas or coal. Additionally, solar energy has a low cost of installation and can be used in remote areas that do not have access to other energy sources. Finally, solar energy is becoming increasingly efficient, with some solar panels now producing roughly the same amount of energy as traditional fossil fuel sources. Overall, solar energy is a viable and cost-effective alternative to conventional energy sources."}, {"instruction": "Identify three benefits of object-oriented programming.", "input": "", "output": "The three benefits of object-oriented programming are: 1) code reusability; 2) improved modularity; and 3) reduced development time and cost. Code reusability involves writing code once and then using the same code in other programs. Improved modularity means that code can be organized into modules that are easier to debug and maintain. Finally, object-oriented programming can reduce development time and cost because it can be used to quickly create complex programs with fewer lines of code."}, {"instruction": "What is one key feature that sets humans apart from robots?", "input": "", "output": "One key feature that sets humans apart from robots is the capacity for creativity.

This steam then passes through a steam turbine to generate electricity. The generator uses the electricity to create an alternating current that is then sent to the power grid. \n\nThe cooling system circulates water around the core of the reactor to regulate its temperature and pressure. This cooling water is then cycled back around the reactor to be reheated and used again.\n\nFinally, the control system uses a combination of computers, sensors, and valves to monitor and regulate the nuclear reaction and the electricity grid. It also monitors the environment to prevent any radiation leaks."}, {"instruction": "Use a classification algorithm to identify whether the following statement is objective or subjective:", "input": "I had a wonderful experience at the restaurant.", "output": "Subjective."}, {"instruction": "Describe the precautionary steps people should take to protect against Coronavirus.", "input": "", "output": "To protect against Coronavirus, people should wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and avoid touching their eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.

This energy may come from ATP or other chemical sources. Active transport requires energy to move molecules against their concentration gradient, while passive transport does not require energy and is driven by the concentration gradient of the molecules. \n\nAdditionally, active transport occurs mainly at specific destinations, such as organelles, while passive transport occurs randomly. Active transport also generally moves large molecules, while passive transport moves small molecules."}, {"instruction": "Generate a CSS code that horizontally centers an iframe.", "input": "", "output": "iframe {\n    position: absolute;\n    top: 50%;\n    left: 50%;\n    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);\n}"}, {"instruction": "Create a costume to match the given term.", "input": "Unicorn", "output": "The costume could include a white hooded robe, a felt unicorn face mask, and a multi-colored mane made from yarn.
