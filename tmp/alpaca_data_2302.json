Both theories have been extremely successful in explaining a wide range of phenomena, yet they often appear to contradict each other. \n\nRelativity is a classical theory that focuses on the behavior of objects on a large, macroscopic scale. It describes gravity as a consequence of the curvature of spacetime, in addition to other phenomena like time dilation and length contraction. \n\nQuantum mechanics, on the other hand, describes the behavior of particles on a much smaller scale. It explains the behavior of particles in terms of probabilities, and suggests that certain phenomena like wave-particle duality are inherent to particles on such a small scale. \n\nIn contrast to relativity, quantum mechanics does not support the notion of an absolute universal frame of reference, suggesting that all frames of reference are, in a sense, equal and relating to each other. \n\nTherefore, despite their differences, the two theories can be seen as complimentary, with each providing valuable insights into the behavior of matter and energy on different scales."}, {"instruction": "What are the most common elements found in the Earth's crust?", "input": "", "output": "The most common elements found in the Earth's crust are oxygen, silicon, aluminum, iron, calcium, sodium, potassium and magnesium.
