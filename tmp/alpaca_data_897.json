Neural networks can be used to classify images by recognizing landmarks and objects in the images. For example, it can be used for facial recognition to detect the facial features of a personâ€™s face. It can also be used for identifying medical images such as X-rays and MRI scans, as well as for recognizing objects and identifying handwriting. Neural networks are also used for autonomous vehicles that rely on real-time image recognition to safely navigate. Other applications include natural language processing and text summarization, as well as stock market predictions. Neural networks also have applications in robotics and autonomous systems, as well as for automated analytics and machine learning."}, {"instruction": "Which problems can be addressed by deep learning?", "input": "", "output": "Deep learning can be used to solve a variety of problems, such as computer vision tasks like image classification, object detection and segmentation; natural language processing tasks such as machine translation and language generation; as well as time series forecasting and other predictive modelling tasks related to financial data and healthcare datasets.

NLP aims to parse and analyze the structure and composition of the language, while NLU is concerned with understanding the context and intention of the language. NLP focuses on producing structured output from unstructured text, while NLU's goal is to extract useful insights from natural language."}, {"instruction": "Create a timeline of the history of computer vision.", "input": "", "output": "The timeline of the history of computer vision starts with the first commercial use of computer vision in 1971, where images were analyzed in order to identify similarities between the images. This was followed by the development of the first computer vision workstations in 1972 and the pioneering works in object recognition and tracking in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In the late 1980s, early neural networks were used in computer vision tasks such as image classification, object recognition and tracking, and 3D object recognition. In the 1990s, advancements in computer vision led to the development of more powerful and sophisticated methods such as convolutional neural networks, feature-based image registration, and content-based image retrieval. In the 2000s, the focus shifted to further advancing deep learning and neural networks for Computer Vision tasks. Today, computer vision is used in a variety of applications, such as autonomous vehicles, facial recognition, medical imaging, and more."}, {"instruction": "Rewrite this sentence to make it imperative: \"You should demonstrate ethical integrity\"", "input": "", "output": "Demonstrate ethical integrity."}, {"instruction": "Rewrite this sentence to make it interrogative: \"Genetic engineering can cause potential harm\"", "input": "", "output": "Can genetic engineering cause potential harm?"}, {"instruction": "How does a GPT-2 model work?", "input": "", "output": "A GPT-2 model is a type of language model that uses a transformer-based architecture to generate human-like text. It works by using an encoder to map an input string to vectors, and a decoder to generate an output sequence one word at a time. The model uses the encoder-decoder architecture to process an input string by taking into account the context of the words in the string, and then generating an output sequence based on the learned information."}, {"instruction": "Explain the difference between generative and discriminative models.", "input": "", "output": "Generative models are used to generate data from a sample, while discriminative models are used to classify and differentiate data sets. Generative models are trained to learn the underlying probability distributions of the data, while discriminative models learn the boundary of the data. Generative models require more data to learn and can estimate unknown classes, while discriminative models require less training data and can only classify known classes. Additionally, generative models are better at handling noisy data and unseen classes, while discriminative models are faster and more accurate at classifying data."}, {"instruction": "What are the three most important characteristics for a good literature professor?", "input": "", "output": "A good literature professor should have a deep understanding of literature and its history, the ability to communicate effectively with students, and the enthusiasm to foster lifelong learning in their pupils."}, {"instruction": "Arrange the following ingredients in the order they should be added to a recipe.", "input": "Onion, Cheese, Tomato, Garlic", "output": "Garlic, Onion, Tomato, Cheese"}, {"instruction": "Generate a realistic scenario involving two people talking.", "input": "", "output": "John and Sarah had been friends since high school, so when John moved to a different city for work two years ago, they were both sad to see each other go.
