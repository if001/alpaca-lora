Data from the 2017 American Community Survey was analyzed to examine changes in median household income, poverty rate, and employment rate between 2011 and 2017. The study found that agricultural subsidies can have a significant positive impact on rural towns' economies, as evidenced by increases in median household income and decreases in poverty and unemployment rate. Furthermore, analysis of individual industries, such as farming and ranching, revealed that agricultural subsidies had a positive effect on these industries in particular.
