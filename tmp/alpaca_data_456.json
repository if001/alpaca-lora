As such, there are some strategies you can use to maximize your learning. \n \n First, create a consistent and dedicated schedule that you’ll stick to. Working a strict schedule doesn’t mean that you’re focusing more on the course; it just adds structure to your learning. Since there’s no instructor in the room, it’s all up to you to stay organized and consistent. \n \n Additionally, break down big concepts into smaller parts. Joining classes and viewing lectures can be intimidating for students. To make the material more manageable, break up the content into smaller segments that are easier to process. \n \n Don’t forget to take regular breaks too. After you’ve gone through a subject or two, take 10 minutes to do some stretching or grab a snack. It’ll help you stay focused and prevents burnout. \n \n Finally, develop a study system. Find the type of study system that works well for you--maybe it’s taking notes, talking to classmates online, or revisiting missed topics. Understanding which techniques are effective for you will help keep your online course on track. \n \n With a few helpful strategies, you’ll be able to successfully tackle any online course.
