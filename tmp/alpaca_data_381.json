Observation is the process of gathering and analyzing information about the environment. Orienting involves using the information to understand the situation and identify the potential opportunities and threats. Deciding is the process of selecting the course of action. Finally, acting is the process of implementing the course of action and adjusting based on the feedback from the environment."}, {"instruction": "Edit the following sentence to eliminate redundancy.", "input": "The verdict of the court was unanimous in agreement.", "output": "The verdict of the court was unanimous."}, {"instruction": "Given two real-life scenarios, select the one that would be classified as a personal decision.", "input": "Scenario A: A teenager who is deciding whether to apply for a job or look for an internship.\nScenario B: A government passing a law that it is illegal to smoke in public parks.", "output": "Scenario A: A teenager who is deciding whether to apply for a job or look for an internship."}, {"instruction": "Replace the text between angled brackets with a proper word.", "input": "He just came back from his <vacation>.", "output": "He just came back from his holiday."}, {"instruction": "Create a magnetic headline to advertise the following product.", "input": "Instant coffee", "output": "Brew Café-Quality Coffee Instantly - with Our Special Instant Coffee!"}, {"instruction": "Suppose you want to remind yourself to do something in the future.

The sun was gone, leaving the world blanketed in darkness.\n\nAt first, there was panic. No one knew what to do or what the future held for the world without light. Soon enough, though, people began to adjust to the new reality and find ways to survive the darkness. Lesser-known stars and constellations became visible in the night sky, and strange creatures of the deep ventured closer to the shore. Some people even began to learn how to speak the language of darkness.\n\nBut no one wanted to imagine life without the sun for long. Each morning, people would watch the sky, searching for a glimpse of the sun's return – praying for a miracle. Eventually, their collective hope paid off. On one fateful day, the sun slowly began to emerge from the darkness like a phoenix rising from the ashes.

Mitosis is a type of asexual reproduction in which a single cell divides into two identical daughter cells. It is primarily used for growth, repair, and maintenance of multi-cellular organisms by providing cells for growth, wound healing, and replacing old or damaged cells. Meiosis, on the other hand, is a type of sexual reproduction that involves two rounds of cell division to produce four haploid daughter cells. It is used in the production of gametes, or sex cells, by providing genetic diversity. The primary difference between mitosis and meiosis is that mitosis produces two daughter cells with the same genetic content, whereas meiosis produces four daughter cells with half the genetic content of the parent cell."}, {"instruction": "Sort the array of numbers in ascending order.", "input": "[5, 1, 9, 3, 4]", "output": "[1, 3, 4, 5, 9]"}, {"instruction": "Delete the all the nouns from the sentence.", "input": "Yesterday I went to the zoo with my friends.", "output": "Yesterday I went to with ."}, {"instruction": "Add the correct punctuation marks to the sentence.", "input": "Aunt Lucy said I can stay up late", "output": "Aunt Lucy said, \"I can stay up late.\""}, {"instruction": "Summarize a research paper in 5 sentences.", "input": "The paper \"A Study on the Effect of Text Messaging on Student Performance\"", "output": "This paper studies the effects of Text Messaging on the performance of students.
