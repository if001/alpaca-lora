Organic chemists primarily study the synthesis and reaction of molecules containing carbon, while biochemists focus on the function and regulation of these molecules in living organisms. Additionally, organic chemists may focus on the synthesis of molecules known to display specific properties, while biochemists investigate the pathways and mechanisms through which these properties are achieved."}, {"instruction": "Describe a datastructure that could be used to store employee records.", "input": "", "output": "A Hashtable could be used to store employee records. A Hashtable is a data structure that stores key-value pair elements, which allows for fast access to records. In this case, an employee record could be stored as a key-value pair, with the employee's name being the key and the employee's other details (age, address, salary, etc) being the value. This would enable quick access to individual employee records as well as the ability to look up records by specific search criteria, such as salary or address."}, {"instruction": "Formulate a mathematical equation to express the movement of 100 g of a substance from a temperature of 273 K to a temperature of 293 K.", "input": "", "output": "The equation for this calculation is Q = mcΔT, where Q is heat, m is mass, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature.
