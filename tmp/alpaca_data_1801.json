Using print statements involves inserting statements into the code that will print out the variable values at that point in the code, which can help identify where the problem is occurring. Another technique is to use a debugging tool, which can provide a detailed view of the code and make it much easier to identify the source of the problem. It can also provide options to step through the code line by line and analyze each line of code."}, {"instruction": "Describe the nature of the political unrest in Syria.", "input": "", "output": "Since 2011, there has been ongoing civil unrest in Syria resulting from the Syrian Civil War, currently in its 10th year.

In the US, health insurance is largely provided through employer-sponsored plans and private insurance companies, while in Canada, health care is provided by a single-payer government-funded system. Additionally, in the US, citizens are expected to pay for most of their health care costs out of pocket, while in Canada, the government fully covers most health care costs. As a result, health care in the US is much more expensive than in Canada, with citizens in the US spending an average of nearly $10,000 per person per year on health care, compared to less than $4,000 in Canada."}, {"instruction": "Create a list of five animals native to Mexico.", "input": "", "output": "- Mexican Beaded Lizard\n- Coati\n- Mexican Gray Wolf\n- Jaguar\n- Margay"}, {"instruction": "Describe how the artificial intelligence (AI) industry is likely to develop in the coming years.", "input": "", "output": "The artificial intelligence industry is likely to grow exponentially in the coming years, with advancements in areas such as deep learning, natural language processing, and robotics.
