They can be used for a range of tasks, such as image generation, text generation, speech recognition, and data prediction. Generative models are trained on large collections of data and usually use deep learning techniques to learn patterns in that data. They are often framed as generative adversarial networks, meaning they learn unobserved data distributions by using two competing models. This type of model has powerful applications in many areas, such as machine translation, image synthesis, and natural language processing."}, {"instruction": "Predict whether the given review is positive or negative.

As climate change drives temperatures up, the number of extreme weather events such as droughts, floods and hurricanes is likely to increase. This can lead to soil erosion, water scarcity, and habitat loss for many species. Increasing temperatures can also disrupt existing patterns of vegetation and species distributions, leading to species extinction and biodiversity loss. Furthermore, rising temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns can encourage the spread of insect and fungal outbreaks, which can devastate large areas of forest and further contribute to habitat loss. Therefore, it is essential to take action to reduce the impacts of climate change on forests."}, {"instruction": "Describe a simple way to reduce water use in the home.", "input": "", "output": "One way to reduce water use in the home is to install low-flow plumbing fixtures such as showerheads, faucets, and toilets.

In the process, water evaporates from bodies of water such as oceans, lakes and rivers into the atmosphere. Then, the water vapor in the atmosphere condenses into clouds, which then release moisture through precipitation back onto the surface of the Earth. This precipitation flows into bodies of water, and the cycle continues."}]
