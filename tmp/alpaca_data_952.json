This means that each particle is instantaneously aware of what changes have been made to the other particle, even though they may be separated by vast distances. This happens without the transfer of information, and it is thought to be an aspect of quantum mechanics that is still not fully understood. In addition to describing two particles in a state of entanglement, the concept can be extended to apply to larger numbers of particles and even collections of particles. As such, quantum entanglement has become an important tool for researchers studying a variety of quantum phenomena."}, {"instruction": "Given a dataframe of employee records, group the employees by age and gender.", "input": "Employees DF:\nName | Age | Gender\nJohn | 35 | Male\nKendra | 25 | Female\nJared | 21 | Male\nRita | 32 | Female", "output": "Group 1 (Male): John (35 years old), Jared (21 years old)\nGroup 2 (Female): Kendra (25 years old), Rita (32 years old)"}, {"instruction": "Find the 8th term in the Fibonacci Sequence", "input": "", "output": "The 8th term in the Fibonacci Sequence is 21.

It would focus on the differentiating features, such as color, shape, and flavor, to accurately assign each item to its corresponding category. For example, apples being red and oranges being orange would be used to differentiate between the two fruits. Similarly, roundness is a distinguishing feature between apples and oranges, with apples being round and oranges being oval. Lastly, apples are usually tart while oranges are usually sweet, giving another way to differentiate between the two fruits."}, {"instruction": "What is the most common shopping cart abandonment reason?", "input": "", "output": "The most common reason for shopping cart abandonment is the cost of a product.

Common examples include fingerprints, facial recognition, voice recognition, and iris scans. These features are used to verify the identity of someone when compared to records stored in a database. Benefits of biometrics include the accuracy of the process in comparison to passwords and pins, as well as the convenience for the user, since biometric authentication does not require the user to remember or enter any information. Additionally, biometrics can be used for continuous authentication, meaning that they can detect if someone is not who they claim to be. This adds an extra layer of security to any system."}, {"instruction": "Given the following sentence, mark the parts of speech: The dog barked loudly.", "input": "The dog barked loudly.", "output": "The (Determiner) dog (Noun) barked (Verb) loudly (Adverb)."}, {"instruction": "Edit the following sentence for clarity: We made cake for breakfast", "input": "We made cake for breakfast", "output": "We made a cake for breakfast."}, {"instruction": "Find a verb phrase that means \"to take away power or authority\"", "input": "", "output": "To disenfranchise."}, {"instruction": "Give 10 features of the sun.", "input": "", "output": "The Sun has a number of distinct features, such as:\n1.

Tom lived in a small village with his family and was always a curious explorer. He was always going off adventuring, exploring every corner of the surrounding countryside.\n\nOne day, Tom decided to venture a little further than usual and walked into an enchanted forest. Here, he encountered many wondrous beasts, mystical creatures and exotic plants that he had never seen before.\n\nTom was so captivated by the beauty of the forest that he decided to stay and explore, and made himself a makeshift home. He created friendships with the animals in the forest, learning everything he could about them and the forest.\n\nTom continued to live in the enchanted forest, learning more and more about its magical species every day. After a while, Tom noticed something strange - the forest was slowly disappearing. He wanted to help save it but didn’t know how, so he called upon the help of his new animal friends.\n\nTogether, they worked hard for days on end and eventually managed to find a way to restore the forest back to its original beauty. Everyone cheered and cheered with joy, and from then on Tom was known as the savior of the enchanted forest."}]
