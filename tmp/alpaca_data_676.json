However, it does not have an inbuilt command-line tool, so developers have to use third-party tools for tasks like compiling, routing, and state management. \n\nAngular is more powerful than React, as it provides an end-to-end platform for developing single-page applications. It is also more “opinionated”, so there is less risk of introducing errors. On the other hand, it has a steeper learning curve and is more complex compared to React. It also has less flexibility and scalability compared to React."}, {"instruction": "Sort the following list of numbers in ascending order: 8, 15, 4, 10", "input": "", "output": "The numbers sorted in ascending order are: 4, 8, 10, 15."}, {"instruction": "List 3 of the most commonly used programming languages", "input": "", "output": "The three most commonly used programming languages are JavaScript, Python, and Java."}, {"instruction": "Why are matrices important in linear algebra?", "input": "", "output": "Matrices are an important tool in linear algebra because they can be used to represent and simplify linear equations.
