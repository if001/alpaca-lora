While some may question the necessity or effectiveness of wearing a mask in everyday life, the evidence clearly illustrates the positive impact that masks can have. Masks act as a physical barrier that helps to keep infected respiratory droplets from entering the air and landing on people or surfaces. Further, masks can significantly reduce the spread of the virus from asymptomatic individuals, providing an additional layer of protection for those around them. As such, wearing masks is an essential precaution that every person should take in order to protect themselves, their loved ones, and their community. \n\nAdditionally, minor inconveniences such as foggy glasses and uncomfortable ears should not be an excuse for not wearing masks. Companies have now developed masks made from comfortable materials that can fit more securely and come with features such as built-in filters and adjustable ear loops for maximum comfort and customization. Educators are also adapting to the situation and making sure children are well-informed and comfortable wearing masks in the classroom. \n\nFrom a public health standpoint, it is clear that masks can play a crucial role in containing the pandemic.
