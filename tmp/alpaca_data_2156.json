It can be used to significantly reduce the time complexity of recursive algorithms by avoiding redundant computation of subproblems, thereby leading to significant performance gains. Furthermore, dynamic programming can help reduce memory usage by storing the results of subproblems. By doing so, it reduces the need to re-execute the same calculations multiple times. This makes dynamic programming highly efficient and suitable for large datasets."}, {"instruction": "What is the smallest positive integer number that is divisible by 5?", "input": "", "output": "5"}, {"instruction": "Expand the following abbreviation in a sentence.", "input": "PC", "output": "Personal computers have revolutionized the way we work and live."}, {"instruction": "Write a poem with four lines and the given words.", "input": "universe, star", "output": "The star in the sky shines so bright,\nIlluminating the night sky on its path of flight.\nThe universe is infinite, so vast and wide,\nWe can only explore a fraction of its might."}, {"instruction": "Describe the differences between cloud computing and traditional computing.", "input": "", "output": "Cloud computing provides greater accessibility and scalability than traditional computing.
