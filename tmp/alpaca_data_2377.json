Automation could also lead to increased wealth inequality, as those with access to the technology and resources to automate will be able to accrue large profits, while workers required to operate the machines have less bargaining power to negotiate better wages and conditions. Finally, automation may lead to higher prices for goods and services, due to reduced competition and economies of scale."}, {"instruction": "Name a celebrity who has become a vegan in the last few years.", "input": "", "output": "Miley Cyrus has been a vegan since 2019 and has spoken out about her decision to do so.
