Design a dataset of coins with different sizes, shapes, and weights to use for training the robot. \n2. Develop a feature-extraction algorithm to detect properties of each coin, such as size and shape.\n3. Develop a classification algorithm to differentiate between types of coins, such as penny, nickel, dime, and quarter.\n4. Train the robot using supervised machine learning and the dataset of coins.\n5. Test the robotâ€™s accuracy and refine the algorithm if necessary.\n6.
