Some of the most common pets are animals, ranging from furry mammals to funny reptiles and everything in between. Each pet animal has unique characteristics, abilities and needs, so it can be helpful to classify these animals into different types in order to make shopping and caring for them easier.\n\nThe first type of pet animal is mammals. This group includes cats, dogs, hamsters and rabbits, all of which are soft, cuddly and full of personality. Cats and dogs are particularly popular choices for pets due to their intelligence, affection and loyalty. When shopping for a pet mammal, it is important to consider the size of the home and level of activity a pet requires.\n\nAnother type of pet animal is reptiles, such as snakes, lizards, turtles and iguanas. These pets require special needs in terms of temperature and humidity levels, and generally must be kept in aquariums or tanks with heating lights. Reptiles are cool to look at and can live longer than other pet animals, but require more resources and attention than mammals.\n\nThe final type of pet animal is birds, including parrots, finches, canaries and more. These birds are ideal for people who prefer a lower-maintenance pet since they do not need to be taken out for long walks or bathed. On the other hand, birds require open cages with plenty of room to fly and play.\n\nIn conclusion, pets are beloved companions providing unconditional love and joy. There are three primary categories of pet animals—mammals, reptiles and birds—each of which has unique characteristics and needs. When choosing a pet animal, consider the size of the home, activity level, dietary needs and other requirements to ensure the animal gets the best care possible."}, {"instruction": "Find an example of a metaphor in this sentence: My life is like a river flowing inexorably.", "input": "", "output": "The phrase \"my life is like a river flowing inexorably\" is an example of a metaphor.
