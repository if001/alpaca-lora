[{"instruction": "Describe the impact cell phones have had on communication", "input": "", "output": "The advent of cell phones has decidedly changed the landscape of communication. The ability to communicate digitally over wireless networks has enabled us to communicate faster and more efficiently with one another. Cell phones have also made communication more accessible to those who were previously unable to make calls due to cost or geography. Additionally, the ubiquity of cell phones has allowed people to easily share information, photos, and videos with friends and family, while also allowing us to stay connected with the broader world. \n\nThe growing role of cell phones in our society has drastically changed how we communicate with one another. Text messages, emails, and digital connections, instead of more traditional face-to-face interactions, have become a primary form of communication for many individuals. As a result, many users have become more attuned to the digital platform, and communication patterns have shifted from less frequent, longer, and more in-depth conversations, to shorter, frequent interactions that focus on context and immediacy. \n\nIn conclusion, the impact of cell phones on communication has been comprehensive: from making communication more accessible, faster, and more efficient; to fundamentally changing how people communicate with one another."}, {"instruction": "Create a list of questions that a new teacher should ask their students during the first week of school", "input": "", "output": "1.

His impressive array of accomplishments include pioneering research in the field of electricity and radio communication, for which he holds over 700 patents.\n\nTesla was born in 1856 in what is now Serbia, and moved to the United States in 1884. He began working for Thomas Edison, but the two soon had a falling out and ended the partnership. Despite this, Tesla managed to turn his passion for electricity into success by founding the Tesla Electric Company.\n\nDuring his life, Tesla made numerous contributions to the fields of electricity, magnetism, and wireless communication. He is also credited with inventing the first alternating current (AC) motor and introducing the three-phase power system, allowing for larger and more efficient electrical networks.\n\nToday, many of Tesla’s ideas and inventions still live on. Without him, it is likely that the world today wouldn’t have the technologies it does."}, {"instruction": "Generate an appropriate response to this email.", "input": "Dear [Name],\n\nI am writing to thank you for your generous donation.
