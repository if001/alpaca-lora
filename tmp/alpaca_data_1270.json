[{"instruction": "Explain how solar energy works.", "input": "", "output": "Solar energy works by capturing the energy from the sun in the form of solar radiation and converting it into electricity. Photovoltaic (PV) cells, which are the most commonly used solar energy technology, are made of semiconductor materials and use a process called the photovoltaic effect. When sunlight hits the cells, the photons in the light interact with the semiconductor material, creating an electric field and generating an electric current. This current is captured and used to generate electricity. Solar energy is a clean, renewable energy source that is becoming increasingly popular, as it is environmentally friendly and cost-effective."}, {"instruction": "Name a dish that contains all the given ingredients.", "input": "Onion, Carrot, Celery", "output": "Mirepoix."}, {"instruction": "Write a sentence that uses \"enmity\" in the correct context.", "input": "", "output": "The two countries held strong enmity towards each other due to past conflicts."}, {"instruction": "Generate three new lines for an incomplete poem.", "input": "The sun rose in the sky\nBringing with it a warmth", "output": "That filled the morning air\nSpreading joy and cheer\nAs far as one could see."}, {"instruction": "Compose three questions about the topic of sustainability.", "input": "", "output": "What actions can individuals take to reduce their carbon footprint?\nHow can businesses adopt environmentally-friendly practices?\nWhat strategies can governments implement to promote sustainability?"}, {"instruction": "Identify which one of the following sentences is an example of hyperbole.
