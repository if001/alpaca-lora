This theorem can be used in cryptography today to test whether a given number is prime or not. In order to use Fermat's Little Theorem, one must select a number a randomly and test whether a^(p-1) - 1 is divisible by p. If yes, then the given number is most likely prime."}, {"instruction": "Describe a situation when a friend is cheating on a test and what should one should do about it.", "input": "", "output": "A friend cheating on a test is an ethical dilemma that can be difficult to navigate. On one hand, it may be beneficial for the friend to \"get away with it\" in the short-term. On the other hand, it is not fair to their peers who are working hard and staying honest. In addition, condoning cheating sets a problematic precedent and encourages similar behavior in the future. In this situation, one should confront their friend and explain why cheating is wrong, and suggest exploring alternative strategies before engaging in unethical behavior."}, {"instruction": "Name a recent space mission which is actively collecting scientific data.", "input": "", "output": "The Parker Solar Probe is a recent space mission operated by NASA which is actively collecting scientific data.

The list of numbers is then divided into ranges for example 0-4, 5-9, 10-14. The frequencies for each range is calculated by counting the number of data points in each range. Finally, each range and the corresponding frequency is recorded in a table. In this case, the frequency distribution table is 0-4: 0, 5-9: 5, 10-14: 1."}]
