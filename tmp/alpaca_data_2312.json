Therefore, it is important that schools have a policy that makes mobile phones off-limits while in school. By banning the use of mobile phones, students and faculty will be able to focus more on their education, as well as maintain a safe and productive learning environment for everyone. \n\nFor starters, cell phones can be a major distraction during class time, as students may become more focused on engaging in text conversations and playing video games instead of listening to the teacher. Additionally, some students may be more inclined to cheat if they can access any forbidden sites or apps on their phone, which could lead to academic dishonesty. \n\nMoreover, mobile phones can also be used by students to take and share inappropriate photos or videos, which can be a major cause of disruption and can also lead to legal issues. Allowing students to bring their personal phones to school can also be a safety hazard, as students could use them to contact someone that is not allowed in the premises. \n\nFinally, banning cell phones in schools is important to protect the mental health of both students and faculty. Allowing phones in the classroom could cause students to compare themselves to their peers, and they could then become stressed or feel inadequate. Additionally, students could become overwhelmed with activity notifications and feel a sense of anxiety or helplessness. \n\nUltimately, mobile phones can be a great tool for learning, but in the school environment it is important to ensure that distractions and potential safety risks are minimized. Therefore, it is essential that schools institute a policy that bans the use of mobile phones in the classroom."}, {"instruction": "Express your opinion on genetically modified food", "input": "", "output": "I believe that genetically modified food has a potential to be beneficial, however there needs to be more thorough research and regulation of the production of such food in order to properly understand and address the risks associated with it.

The first step is to calculate the nontaxable income and deductibles. Nontaxable income includes childcare expenses, healthcare payments, and other expenses that are not subject to income taxes. Deductibles includes the cost of housing and transportation, such as rent or mortgage payments and car payments, respectively. \n\nThe total nontaxable income and deductions should be subtracted from the family’s gross income, or their salary before taxes, to calculate the net income. This net income should be divided into two categories, which are to be allocated as follows: \n\n- 60% is allocated to needs, such as food, utilities, and housing; \n- 40% is allocated to wants, such as entertainment and leisure activities. \n\nAfter allocating the income, the next step is to save 10% of the family’s net income each month.
