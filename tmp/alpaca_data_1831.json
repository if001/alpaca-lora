In addition, increasing ocean temperatures are causing increasingly powerful and frequent hurricanes, leading to increased property damage and loss of life. Furthermore, rising temperatures and sea levels are also having a devastating effect on marine life, with ocean acidification causing coral bleaching and reducing populations of fish and other aquatic species.\n\nIt is clear that in order to save the planet from rising sea levels, immediate action must be taken to reduce the effects of climate change.
