In the midst of massive lockdowns and social distancing, we managed to learn a few things about this virus. For starters, it is apparently very contagious, as it spread like wildfire around the globe. We have also come to realize though, that the virus only targets those who aren’t following specific protocols. Wearing a face covering, washing your hands and staying home has proven to be the ultimate remedy – the only thing standing in the way of avoiding infection. Taking preventive measures has significantly reduced the spread of the virus, and yet, people are still getting sick. Is this virus selectively choosing who to infect? It just doesn’t make sense! We may never know the answer, but at least we can attempt to stay safe and healthy."}, {"instruction": "Create a function to check whether two strings are anagrams.", "input": "", "output": "def is_anagram(s1, s2): \n    s1 = sorted(s1.lower()) \n    s2 = sorted(s2.lower()) \n    return s1 == s2"}, {"instruction": "Explain what is a neural network", "input": "", "output": "A neural network is an artificial intelligence (AI) system inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain.
