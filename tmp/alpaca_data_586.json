Water then falls to the Earth, where it can either evaporate again into the atmosphere or be carried down into waterways and streams. This water can then flow back into the oceans completing the cycle. \n// end of output //"}, {"instruction": "Edit the sentence \"Animals shouldn't mistreated\"", "input": "Animals shouldn't mistreated", "output": "Animals should not be mistreated.\n// end of output //"}, {"instruction": "Compare and contrast an object-oriented programming language with a procedural programming language", "input": "", "output": "Object-oriented programming languages and procedural programming languages differ in terms of the fundamentals of programming.
