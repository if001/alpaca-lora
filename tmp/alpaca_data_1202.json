It uses a type of electronic circuitry called a circuit-switched network to enable two or more users to communicate with each other over a long distance. A telephone works by converting sound into electrical signals and sending them over a network of copper or fiber-optic cables. The electrical signals are then converted into sound by a handset placed near the user's mouth or ears. The recipient's handset then decodes these signals and reproduces the sound. Telephones also have other features such as caller ID and voicemail. \n \nTelephones typically consist of four parts – a microphone, receiver, transmitter and dial – connected to a network of cables. The microphone converts sound into electrical signals, which are sent to the transmitter. The transmitter sends the signal to the receiver via a network of cables. The receiver decodes the signal and then sends it to the speaker, which converts it back into sound. When the user dials a number, the dialing generates electrical impulses that are sent to the telephone exchange, which routes the call to the desired destination. Once the call is connected, the two parties can then communicate.\n \nIn short, telephones convert sound into electrical signals, transmit these signals over a network of cables, decode them at the receiver, and then reproduce the sound in order to enable two or more parties to communicate."}, {"instruction": "Change the following paragraph into an active voice.", "input": "The car was driven to the shop by me.", "output": "I drove the car to the shop."}, {"instruction": "Generate two original metaphors to describe the feelings of fear and regret.", "input": "", "output": "Fear is like standing on the edge of a cliff; you feel like you are about plunge into an unknown abyss. \nRegret is like looking into a dark mirror; no matter how hard you try, you can't undo the past."}, {"instruction": "Construct a timeline showcasing the progression of human civilization.", "input": "", "output": "Human civilization has progressed through numerous stages and achieved significant milestones throughout history.
